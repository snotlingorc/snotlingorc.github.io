Senator Helenites Osteropolus of Thiatus is known for this gladiators and his high waging.

A high wage was made on his prize fighter that night.  Oresta, the Orc pit figher, won the battle and the Senator
won his bet.  With 300 extra gold in his pocket, the Senator allowed Orestra to choose a slave girl to spend the night
with him.  A few months later Orestra was able to purchase this freedom, but left the now pregnant slave girl.
Born months later a new slave gladiator was presented with the magical branding of House Osteroplus.

Over the years, Took was trained for fighting and was to be prize gladiator like his father.

after 16 years of fighting, Took was being sent to Kerendas to train with one of the great pit fighters, Yallig.
Yalig is the only known gladiator to turn down membership of the sands.  Yallig also bought his freedom after 7 years
of fighting.  He stayed on with the house to train and gain prosperity.

During the transport to Kerendas, the caravan stopped over in Briddleton.  The escort struck up a wager with some of
the Inn's patrons.  Took was removed from his cage and was forced to fight a wild boar.  After a successful battle he
was put back into his cage, but the lock was not set.  Noticing this, Took waited for the right moment and escaped in
the night.

Took was able to take passage on a ship, by working in the rigging.  He sailed from the lands of Thiatus to Minithrad
where he enlisted as a scupper on the Oceans Ghost.
