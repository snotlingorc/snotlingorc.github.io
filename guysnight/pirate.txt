Back to the ship.  Inform captian/firstmate about the halfing and his message.
Xeno ironfist joined the team.  A chatty cathy type of person.  Make sure we keep our business to ourselves.

want to go to the Hermitage (in black rock - 200 miles from stronghold about 4 days) and see the oracle on the way to elf isle,
to see if we can find out more about the halfing.

blown off course 2nd day in,  to the south in the sea of dread.. almost back on course.. see a dark spot in the sea.. not land or another ship.
See 6 camaran sailing vessels.  Break out from the mass and start sailing towrads us. they approach the ship, about 200 ft away.
and ask what business is with Kron.  "Visitors passing though! would like to visit Kron and see if any trade is to be had".  Go to
the floating city of Kron.  It is 14 large rafts (200-400 ft).  100s of small rafts.  each with a single building on it.

The harbor master invits us to visit with King one-eye. we are brought along as guards of the captain for the meeting.
12 guards inthe throne room for One-eye.  Morack the advisor stands next to the king. The first mate, Falcon, is in charge of the guards is here as well.

the king denies any knowledge of the dark tide rises. But Morack seems to be hiding something about the dark tide.

Off shift - Go find Morack.. at least ask about him. His quarters are in the main building.  he keeps to himself and does not frequent any of the local dives.
his quarters are huge.  a rounded wall on the inside.   only two may enter.
after they get back.  one of the guards says to meet by the tavern.  a little gold and he will give us info.

off to the tavern. willing to buy some of the dwarvern mead.  going to boat to bring back a barrel.

Meanwhile.. a guy in normal grab sits next to the bard and starts to talk.  "Me" is his name.
Morack is working for someone.. not in this city.  from the ocean.. an island somewhere south.. he is working for them!
I am learning magic from him.  He is dangerous.  His intenctions are not for this city.  He has been here for 3 years.  only
the last year has he started to exerting influance over one-eye..  he suggests things, magic is involed.. and the king agrees.

the guard seems to see a shadow and pops off the stool and runs away.

back with the mead.  Bard starts to perform.  all is well.
rumors -
* new restrictions on some of the rafts.. off limits.  you cannot use that part of the city.
* Divers cannot dive in some of the more fruitful haunts
* Morack has been here about 3 years. working his way up to advisor.  He is always around.

head back to boat to rest. Inform captain.  he does not want to take part of this yet.  and wants to leave as soon as possible.

getting ready to set sail. heading east by northeast.  another 2 days. arrive at black rock island.

half peak is an active volcano on the island.  small fishing village (Hermian) on one side.
we are on guard detail with the el'capitan.  get directions to the hermitage. they Point to the lava fields.
arrive at the hermitage.  the island is rather green and plant life is aplenty.  greated by robbed people.

Oracle of the mystery of lore.  captain requests for knowledge about the dark tide rising.
* the dark tide rising ais an ancient evil from an island in the far south.  WIll be waves of undead.  Death slaughter to
appeas the worhippers.  will affect trade.. I see death in the seas below and to the east.  Tide tide is supernatural.
Undead vesel to the east connected?  yes.  the floating city will be desgtroyed.  Morack is no good. no way to stop the affects of the morack to king one-eye
the path we are upon know should be followed through.

Have a gift. . a Ring on a platter.  This will help you when you venture underwater.  (water breathing)
