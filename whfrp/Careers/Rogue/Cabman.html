Subject: [WFRP:1324] New profession
<p>
<dd>   Hi from Russia!  Privet iz Rossii!
<dd>   Excuse me please for some discrepancies with original WFRP termi-
nology - there is no Games Workshop stores in Russia,  and all I  have
is a xerocopy of WFRP book in French.  I propose for your judgement my
first independent project.  A couple years ago I have read a novel  by
Russian  emigree  to  US  Vladimir Lobas which was named "Diary of New
York cabby".  I enjoyed it much - even designed a board game after it.
So my humble contribution is...

         <b>Financial side of the profession</b><br>
     First thing to mention is that cabman owns his cab and thus endu-
res all  risks  connected with the profession.  To feed and stable his
horse he needs 8/- to 10/- a day.  To pay for average-quality food and
room in  outskirts  of the city he needs another 8/-.  It is harder to
stimate how much profit does he need to maintain his enterprise but  I
think that 1 GK is minimum.  So,  he must earn 2 GK a day.  Working 10
hours in a day he can pick up a passenger,  say, once in half an hour.
To earn  2GK  from 20 passengers he must take from each passenger 2/-.
Each trip 10-15 minutes long can cover 1-3 km. So, average payment for
cab service is 1 shilling per km.
<p>
         <b>Physical side of the profession</b><br>
     A horse has strength of 3 and so can carry on its  back  900  EP.
One can  agree  that  10 EP is approx 1 kg.  There is no indication in
WFRP book at mass of _pulled_ cargo.  Realistic preposition is that it
is another  three  times more than horseback load.  So,  one horse can
pull 270 kg. A cabman weighs 70 kg (or less if he is a hobbit :-)), so
he can carry three passengers without encumbrance.  In this  case  his
horse trots at velocity of 8, making 11-12 km/hour.
<p>
         <b>Role-playing side of the profession</b><br>
     First, cabman's own transport can carry  adventurers  around  the
world cheaply and with speed.  Secondly,  entering mountainous  region
adventurers  can  hide the carriage and use the horse for carrying the
luggage.
<p>
     If adventurers roleplay in cabman's home city,  his perfect know-
ledge of inns and outs of this city will be precious for party. Indeed
he knows criminal world of the city very well. If party is in despera-
te need of funds,  he can pick up a wealthy  passenger  and  rob  him,
threatening  with  a pistol.  Less criminal way of raising funds is to
sell cart and horse (and pistol too?  The pistols are precious in  the
Old World ;-)).

     Thank you for reading this stuff.
