<h2>BARKEEP-------------Version 0.1</h2>
Rogue Basic Career
</center>
<p>
In a world as treacherous and brutal as most Old Worlders world is, 
many turn to the comforts of alcohol and the people who serve them.  
A Barkeep needs to be able to provide a drink, a smile and an 
attentive ear and the advice that accompanies it.  Barkeeps learn to 
talk to people and how to get on their good side.  Sometimes force
must be used with an unruly or drunken customer and they may become 
quite adept at stunning these drunks and throwing them out.  
Occassionally  a Barkeep will eventually own his own Inn, but sometimes 
the many stories of  treasure and adventure heard from his patrons can 
cause a Barkeep to become an adventurer.
