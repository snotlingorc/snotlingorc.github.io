Subject: WFRP: The Gypsy Career (take two)<br>

Hi All!<br>

Here's the modified gypsy career. Hope it can be of use to someone!

<h2>GYPSY</h2>
</center>
<p>
Almost anywhere in the Old World is it possible to stumble upon
a band of Gypsies. They roam the roads and waterways between the
towns and villages, stopping to trade at any settlement they come
to.
<p>
The travelling people or Rom as they call themselves, travel
around the Old World, not staying around the same spot for more
than a few days. The Gypsies are often shunned by other people,
who doesn't understand the Gypsy way of life. While the Gypsies
are a welcome sight in the remote areas they visit, bringing news
as well as trade goods, they are never encouraged to stay long,
since they are held in a certain amount of mistrust by the bulk
of the population, and there are always a few thefts and other
incidents when they are about.
<p>
Gypsies doesn't care for money or goods. If they need anything,
and they can't afford to buy it, they steal livestock from the
local farmers, and sell it another town. The Gypsies don't see
this as stealing, since they don't accept the laws of the land
they're in - they only accept their own law or court-system,
called the Kris. This can lead to a lot of trouble, and that is
one of the main reasons the Gypsies are disliked by the popula-
tion - "They think they can do anything. Someone ought to punish
them Gyps, show 'em who's in control. They think they own the
world. A whole bunch of thieves. The Gypsies don't steal from
people, who allows them to camp on their land, or people, who
wants to help them. They remember this kind of friendship, and
they are likely to lend a helping hand, or return the favour one
day. If a Gypsy does anything to harm a person "marked" as a
friend, he or she gets the worst possible punishment from the
Kris - exclusion from the tribe. Imagine being alone in an
unfriendly country!
<p>
While some Gypsy tribes stay clear of most human settlements, and
just enter the towns to trade, others make a living by travelling
from fair to fair in their coloured boats/wagons, entertaining
with music, animal shows and/or divinations.
