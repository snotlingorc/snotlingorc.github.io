<h2>Informer</h2>
-----Advanced career-----
</center>
<p>


        In their effort to get an edge against organised crime the
police-force is often forced into using "unfair" methods and one of these
is the use of an Informer.
<p>
        There are many types of Informers but the most common one is when
simple watchmen go under cover and enter one of the various crime-guilds
such as the renowned thieves-guild.
<p>
        The procedure is that the trusted (or expendable) watchman is
contacted by his superior and gently forced into this new way of helping
the City, State and Emperor. Often his new career will take place in
another city to reduce the risk of his discovery.
<p>
        This kind of operation is often led by a small group within the
police force and the crime lords are constantly trying to get their own
informant in there and who knows they might already have succeeded for all
the Informer knows....
<p>
        Getting help from the ones in charge of the operation, he will
quickly, if all goes well, establishes a reputation as an expert thief
getting to the most difficult places in town (none is told about doors
being left open or watch-men turning a blind eye) and once he has entered
the higher ranks of the guilds the informing begins.
<p>
        Needless to say the risk of his discovery is great even with all
the precautions taken and the punishment even higher...
<p>
        Another common type of informer is the thief who gets caught and is
given the chance of avoiding death or the loss of a hand by ratting on his
bosses moves to the police.
<p>
        But with both of these types of informers the police can never be
sure if the information is correct as the Informer might switch sides and
give misleading evidence.
<p>
         The Informers lives a risky life as even the slightest word that
gets out will lead to their untimely death.. and should they get away with
it they will probably live in fear of the Organisations shadow for the rest
of their lives...

<b>Entered from:</b>
        Watchman
        Thief,
        Beggar(???)
<br>
<b>Exits:</b>
        Watchman (another city!)
        Watchman Sergeant (if done well to the police force)
        Thief, (by doing the organisation a "favour" he might be accepted)
        Outlaw (Both sides hunting him!)

<b>NOTES:</b><br>
<ul>
        *---He's gonna need these to try and fool the poor thieves.
<br>        * *---To increase his petty chances.
<br>        #---Well, I'm thinking that this guys nerves must be wrecked and
becoming an alcoholic  seems inevitable, maybe the police encourages
this so that he can be put away to some asylum silently after the operation
is finished?
</ul>
<p>
        I was thinking about giving Insanity points or some minor disorders
to this poor fool (nail biting seems inevitable) but it might be too cruel?
My plans were to have one of my PC's get into this involuntarily, so I
would very much appreciate any feedback(, if you haven't fallen asleep that
is), and maybe this guy exits already, made by someone else? In that case I
would very much appreciate any experience and/or details?
