<h2>PROSTITUTE</h2>
 (A new basic career for rogues)
</center>
<p>
  It has been said that this is the world's oldest profession and apart from
being the oldest, it is also one of the most widespread. Prostitutes can be
found in almost every corner of the Old World, but the society does not always
appreciate their existance, so they often operate hidden from the public.
<p>
  Prostitutes are often looked down at, so most of them are in their
profession because life offers them few possibilities to do something else.
But when exits are open to pursue other ways, they are often greeted welcome.
