Hi folks,
<p>
thank you for all your comments about my posting concerning
the WFRP career inn-keeper !
I barely had time lately and will try now to revise the career :
<hr>

<center>
<h2>* INN-KEEPER (2nd try)</h2>
basic career for WFRP
</center>
<p>

<b>Career Class:</b> Rogue
<br>
<b>Description:</b> You know this one, don't you
<p>
Advanced Scheme:
<table border=5>
<tr>
<th>M</th><th>Ws</th><th>Bs</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>W</th><th>I</th><th>A</th><th>Dex</th><th>Ld</th><th>Int</th><th>Cl</th><th>Wp</th><th>Fel</th></tr>
<th></th><th>10</th><th></th><th>1</th><th></th><th>2</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th>10</th><th></th><th></th><th>10</th><th>10</th></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>Restrictions:</b>
Inn-keeper cannot be taken as a character's first career by humans.
<p>
<b>Comments on restrictions:</b>
<blockquote>
    My first thought was to give the inn-keeper an Advanced Career status
    because most people don't begin their lives as an inn-keeper but 
    inn-keeper is a profession if you want to settle down from your 
    adventurous life.<br>
    But the advences of this career aren't that much, so I decided to 
    declare it as a BASIC CAREER with this restriction.
    Dwarves and Elves are usually older when begining their life as a 
    Old World hero, so -okay, why not as inn-keeper...

Comments on skills:<pre>
    Why only so little chance of brewing ?
    * There is a a cereer in WFRP called Artisan - Brewer !
      Every inn that doesn't brew its beer on their own has 
      a contract with a brewery... When giving the inn-keeper 
      'brewery' automatically the artisan (brewer) career is 
      nearly senseless...
    Why 100 % chance of streetfighter ??
      * Every inn-keeper will learn to defend himself in a 
      brawl. That's what this skill is all about. (okay, not 
      everyone, but the old and ugly, fat and anxious 
      inn-keeper is not the type of career our PCs want to 
      enter).
    Why no administration skill ?
      * I know of none... So tell me one or create a new one !
      * Why not Read/Write skill ?
      There is no need in learning read or write for an inn-keeper
    Why percentage system for a career which cannot be the 
    first one ?
      * Because there are several types of inn-keepers in the 
      Old World...
    Why does this career have a chance to get Very Strong skill ?
      * This is a little extra (personal preference) bonus to keep 
      in mind that it is not always a good idea to mix up the 
      inn-keeper because the prices are in a way too high ....

      ...sorry, but in my groups players love to challenge 
      inn-keepers for letting them wait some seconds or handing 
      out warm beer...  So I decided to strengthen every tenth 
      of them a little bit.  If you don't like it, just feel free 
      to delete it.
