ADVANCED ROGUE CAREER
</center>
<p>

Inspectors are the Elite of the Cities watch, answerable to only 
the Watch Captain himself.  Inspectors are the investigators of 
crimes.  The job requires great perception and a resourcefullness 
that is hard to find.  All major cities employ several Inspectors 
whose primary duties are investigating crimes, of course the 
overwhelming majority of these crimes deal with the rich and the 
nobles.  Very rarely is the death of a commoner ever thought of as 
something worth an Inspector's time.  Occasionally an Inspector
will uncover a trail leading towards someone of considerable social 
or economic status.  It is at these times that an Inspector must 
make hard decisions concerning his committment to the Law and the 
common good and his connection to the prevailing power structure, 
and who he serves.
