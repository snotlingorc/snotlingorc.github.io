Subject: WFRP: Master Thief<br>
<hr>
<p>
  <i>Notes:</i>  The Master Thief is supposed to be an expert in his chosen 
fields, a sort of highly trained specialist in a few fields.  As 
such, it is not a traditional career, but more of a template or set 
of rules to create a "specialized" and unique thief of epic 
proportions.  I have never play tested it, but I do get bored or 
inspired and write stuff up.
<p>
  <i>Note:</i>  With the introduction of Master Thief, normal thieves should 
only be allowed to purchase skills like Pick Pocket, and Pick locks 
twice for a total bonus of +20

  At this point, the character has four  slots.  If the character 
likes, he can take one or two of the slots and add them to the 
advance scheme.  It adds +1 or +10 to the respective advance (Wounds 
+2).  No advance may go over +40 or +3.  Any slots not used to 
increase the advance scheme can be used on skills.
<p>
<font size=4>Skills:</font>  The character can buy four slots, minus any spent to increase 
the advance scheme, to purchase in specialties or abilities.  Every 
time the character wishes to apply a slot for an advance or skill, 
they must spend 100 Exp points to gain the advance or skill.
<p>
<b>Acrobatics:</b> costs one slot.  Can only be purchased once.  
<br>
<b>Acute Hearing:</b> costs one slot.  The character's sense have been 
  sharpened by experience and neccessity.
<br>
<b>Ambidextrous:</b> costs one two slots.  Can only be used after both slots 
  have been purchased.
<br>
<b>Conceal Urban: Advanced.</b>  When one slot is used to turn the skill to 
  Advanced, the modifiers for concealment are doubled.  The character 
  must have Conc Urb before he can advance it.
<br>
<b>Contortionist:</b>  costs one slot.
<br>
<b>Disguise:</b> costs one slot.
<br>
<b>Escapology:</b> costs one slot.
<br>
<b>Lightning Reflexes:</b>  costs three slots.  Long years of training and 
  experience have honed the characters' reflexes to perfection.  Can 
  only be used after all three slots have been purchased.
<br>
<b>Luck:</b>  costs two slots.
<br>
<b>Mimic:</b> costs one slot.
<br>
<b>Palm Object: Advanced:</b> When used to turn the previously purchased 
  skill into an advanced one, the bonus is now +25
<br>
<b>Pick Locks Advanced:</b>  Up to two slots can be added to this skill 
  making the pick lock bonus +30 or +40.
<br>
<b>Pick Pockets Advanced:</b>  Identical to Pick Lock Advanced.
<br>
<b>Scale Sheer Surface Advanced.</b>  For the cost of a slot, the skill now 
  offers a +25 bonus to all Risk Tests.
<br>
<b>Sense Magical Alarm:</b>  Costs two slots.  The character, when within 
  ten feet of an alarm, can detect Magic alarms, by testing against 
  their Will Power.
<br>
<b>Silent Move Urban:</b> Advanced:  When a slot is spent to turn the basic 
  skill into an Advanced one, the bonus is now -20.
<br>
<b>Sixth Sense:</b> costs two slots.  The character has acquired a certain 
  knack for knowing when he's being followed...
<br>
<b>Spot Trap Advanced:</b>  When a slot is spent to turn the basic skill 
  into an Advanced one, the bonus to spot is +20, and to disarm the 
  bonus is +10.
<p>
<b>Career Entries:</b> (at least two fully completed)
  Thief (general),                   Assasin,
  Thief (any specialists),	    Racketeer,
  Footpad,                           Spy,
  Fence
<p>
<b>Career Exits:</b>
  Initiate (Ranald),
  Guildmaster-Thieves,
  Crimeboss
<p>
  The goal of this career is to allow the expert thief to acquire 
specialties and unique skills, a sort of flexible template to allow 
thieves to have a sort of personality, instead of skills like Pick 
Pocket, etc.  By using the slot system, it makes purchasing advances 
and innate skills painful by robbing the character of true expertise 
in one or two skills...

  This is the one career I made that I'm totally unsure of.  I've 
never play tested it, and it looks a little akward or complex... It 
could be promising though...
  Comments?  I posted the stupid career despite my reservations...
