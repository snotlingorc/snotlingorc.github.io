<h2>PROSTITUTE</h2>
</center>
<p>
Prostitutes ply their trade in all of the large population centres of 
the Old World, especially those with large maritime or military 
centres. They can range from individual traders to organised 
brothels, and their talents and costs vary greatly. Many in their 
position get to learn great secrets from loose mouthed lovers and 
pass along a great deal of information to other 'concerns'.
