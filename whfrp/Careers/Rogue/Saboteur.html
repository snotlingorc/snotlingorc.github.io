<h2>SABOTEUR</h2>Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  A Saboteur is greatly feared by the authorities.  Saboteurs, working as 
agents for spies of hostile foreign groups, or as political terrorists, will 
destroy buildings and target important individuals.  Saboteurs working 
as spies will often infiltrate administrative buildings, blowing them up 
with bombs and gunpowder, or during times of war, blowing up ships 
at port, military barracks, fortifications, and causing severe injuries and 
deaths.
<p>
  Often hostile political groups within an area will wage a campaign of 
terror against the local populace or the authorities.  Blowing up magistrates 
or nobles, various political extremist groups usually claim responsibility.
