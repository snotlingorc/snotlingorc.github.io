<h2>The Su Lim Monastary of Cathay</h2>
</center>
<p>

<b>History:</b><br>
	Around 1100 years ago an enlighted one came to the province.  After 
	advising the Prince on some matters he went to the mountains to 
	meditate.  He sat in a cave meditating for nine years and when he 
	was done, he found that his legs had atrophied.  By this time, news 
	of the holy man meditating in the cave had spread bringing onlookers 
	and potential followers from the surrounding lands.  When the holy 
	man came out of his meditations he had his new followers take him to 
	a nearby monastary, where he started to teach.  The focus was on 
	deep meditation, but now he also taught physical exercises so that 
	his students would be able to stand the rigors of meditation.  These 
	exercises were the beginnings of Su Lim Gung Fu, or Su Lim Boxing.
	Around 500 years ago there was a split in the monastary.  The abbot 
	was very old an needed a successor.  The most likely candidate was 
	not enlightened but was well read and popular.  This student one 
	night wrote a poem about enlightenment on the wall.  While the abbot 
	and a few of the students were reading the poem, an illiterate 
	groundskeeper asked someone to read the poem aloud.  The 
	groundskeeper laughed and replied in such a manner that at once 
	all those present knew he was enlightened. (The story is of the 
	sixth patriarch of the Sui Lum Temple in China, the name was Hui Neng) 
	Knowing that the next abbot should be enlightened, the abbot passed on 
	his robes and bowl to the Groundskeeper and told them to flee.  This 
	divided the Su Lim Monastary into the Southern and Northern schools, 
	The Groundskeeper and the other guy, respectively.
	This section deals with the southern school.  The excersices evolved 
	into martial arts based on five animals.  The animals are, 
	respectively, The Crane, The Monkey, The Tiger, The Manits, and the 
	Dragon.  Each style is learned at a consecutive level.  Initiates are 
	taught Crane and so on.

<b>Special Skills designated by *</b><br>
<p>
<b>Meditation</b>:  Meditation is much more intense for the Su Lim Monks.  It is 
the path to enlightenment, the goal of every Su Lim Monk.  The Su Lim monk 
must take meditation at each level.  This has the following cummulative 
effects.  The monk must meditate one hour for each level in meditation 
that they have each day.  (e.g. a monk who has taken meditation at levels 
one two and three and initiate, must meditate for four hours each day)  
The monk also get an additional 5% for roles agianst illusions for each
level of meditaion past the first. (i.e. 2-5)  The monk must have meditated 
that day if she wants to use any of the special skills for Si Lum monks.  
If they don't meditate it also ruins the strongman diet if they are of that 
level.
<p>
<b>Parry-strike</b>:  The monk has become so fast and fluid that she can not only 
parry, but strike every time she parries.  This can only be in hand to hand 
combat, no weapons.  The base damage for this strike is S + d6-5.
<p>
<b>Ch'i strike</b>:  The Ch'i strike is the most deadly of strikes known.  It 
requires incredible will and physical prowess.  The monks mind and body must 
be one.  (Note: If you are silly enough to allow a PC to get this far, make 
them act like a monk whos mind and body are one.  If they don't they can't 
do it)  The Ch'i strike works as follows.  The monk states that she is going 
to try a Ch'i strike, they must ehn make a successful WillPower roll.  If 
that succeeds they must then successfull hit their target, then roll damage.  
An equal amount of magic points are then removed from the monks total. (If 
the monk made the WP roll, hit and then did 8 points of damage, subtract 8 
magic points,) and then double the damage done, this attack counts as magical.
If the monk does more damage that they have magic points then they have 
drained themselves too far.  They take a point of damage for each magic 
point they spent over their maximum, in addition all their stats are halved 
until they can meditate for at least an hour per wound taken.
<p>
<b>Multi-Strike:</b>  Multi strike is similar to Parry-strike.  The monk attacks as 
normal, but then follows through with another attack.  This is like throwing 
a punch and then folling in and hitting the target with an elbow also.  The 
first attack does normal damage, the second does S+d6-5.  The character is 
also -10 to dodge and parry tests.
<p>
Monks must take the Priest advance test to advance a level.  Test include 
feats of meditation such as meditating under a waterfall for three days, 
watching a crystal grow, begining to end, without taking a break, inventing 
a new type of exercivse based on a new animal, note: if this is tried they 
creator must fight and beat a master of each of the other five animals.  Has 
only been done twice.  If short on ideas watch some old Kung-fu movies and 
somethign will come to you.
