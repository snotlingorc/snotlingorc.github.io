<h2>Artisan - Locksmith</h2>
</center>
 
<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>  The locksmith is able to get in most places, were other 
  people can't, that's his trade. What most people don't think about is his 
  ability to open locks without being asked to do so. This is a favourite 
  cover for thieves. Locksmiths are usually only found in the larger towns.
  Only wealthier families can afford a good Locksmith because they don't 
  just buy a lock, they also buy the Locksmith's discretion...
