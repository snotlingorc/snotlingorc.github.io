<h2>Cultivators:   (Basic)</h2>
</center>

   <dd>Cultivators (also known as Seeders, Harvesters, or Greenpants) are
wanderers who are experts in the conservation and replenishment of the
earth's fertility, as well as the treatment of diseased plants.  They travel
from village to village sharing their lore with the local farmers and assist
them if needed.  Some Cultivators have taken to planting and tending (as well
as protecting) orchards on a small cleared parcel of land along roads in the
wilderness.  The famous Johann Kirschesaat (who planted fruit trees along the
Nuln-Moot Road to feed weary travelers) is an example of this type of
Cultivator. 
   <dd>To become a Cultivator, one must have been an initiate of Rhya for at
least one year and selected by a second level Cleric.
