<h2>Diplomat- Advanced Career</h2>
</center>
<p>
  Diplomats are representatives of various noble houses and nations.  
These diplomats are highly distinguished individuals who are used to 
deal with problems between other countries.  As opposed to 
Ambassadors, who are the representatives of their countries, 
diplomats are distinguished individuals dispatched to take care of 
urgent matters.  These matters could be negotiations about trade, 
border disputes, peace treaties, alliances, threats of war, the 
diplomat is the person for keeping his countries interests safe.  As 
such they are highly competant individuals, well trained, and well 
paid.

<b>New Skill: Diplomacy</b><br>
  The diplomacy skill allows the character to understand and 
negotiate correctly in affairs concerning the state.  The character 
has a reaonable understanding of national issues of his and other 
countries, and how to manipulate and alter negotitions in his favor.  
It works nearly the same as haggling.  It's up to the GM to decide 
how he chooses to Test this skill.  Remember that diplomatic actions 
are long tedious affairs with proposals, counterproposals, demands, 
compromise, and a good deal of lying!  Fun!
<p>
<i>Notes:</i>  This diplomat was designed to fulfill the roles for one of 
the PC's after Empire in Flames.  I think that a Ambassador career, 
while interesting, could prove sedentary.  This career offers a lot 
of traveling, and is a good way of allowing the character's to get 
around the Old World and beyond at their lieges' expense!  
Assasination attempts, spies, false diplomatic orders, ambushes, and 
all kinds of political intrigue can develop out of this career.  It 
also provide a useful NPC class, with the players as the diplomats 
escort.  I often have the Emperor also send Diplomats as envoys, with 
the PC trying to rob free towns such as Kemperbad of their autonomy.
That makes for one devious adventure, trying to undermine people's 
freedom for territorial gain and taxes! Devious!<br>
  <dd>I took three skills that I had originally included in my post because 
I wasn't sure if they were neccessary.  You may want to include them, 
and you might not.  Acting, so he would be able to present a false 
facade while he's lying through his teeth, Public Speaking, allowing 
him to make gradiose speeches at formal affairs, and Wit to allow him 
to charm and ingratiate himself to the other parties in the 
negotiations.  What do you think?  Should they stay or should they 
go?<br>
  <dd>By the way, people who spend time designing, playtesting, and 
finally posting their careers, may possibly appreciate some response 
or criticism to all their hard work.  If you enjoy seeing new posts, 
you might want to indulge their author's need for attention.  Not 
that I'm implying anything...<br>
  <dd>But if you do happen to respond, they would be greatly appreciated. 
So write!
