Subject: WFRP: Witches in WFRP - not just Charlatans
<p>
Hi all,
<p>
As promised few months ago, I'm now sending what I have developed about
witches in WFRP. Recently the article has been rejected by a roleplaying
magazine, so I'm free to send it to the list. Its editor didn't seem to
like it too much. :(( On the other hand, he will publish other articles
of mine, so I'm not too whiny about this. The article is IMHO usable and
does not destroy the flair of the game.
<p>
The following article is far from being complete, but I lost motivation
to develop it further because my players lost contact with witches in my
game. If you expect ready-to-run-enhencements, then please ignore it.
Otherwise, you may feel free to use it in your home campaign and even
work on the incomplete parts of it as long as you mention my original idea
in your scripts.
<p>
Not all of you will like the general concept of this, because it mixes
different spell types which is an unusual thing. However, if you only
dislike this feature, then re-write a Witch spell with details changed for
each spell listed below. For example, a Witch 'Fly' spell could be by far
more powerful...
<p>
Send your comments on this to the WFRP mailing list (wfrp@gojira.monsta.com)
or to me (rossi@cs.tu-berlin.de) via email. Regardless of what has been said
here lately about a commentiquette (see Netiquette), also raise your voice
if you dislike something. I have thick hide and will eagerly try to discuss
any attempt of criticism.
<p>
If you like the stuff, feel free to blather me to develop it further (of
course, donations of all types will help here :)...The most embarrassing
thing to me would be that this article would be ignored totally...
<p>
So, here we go...

<h2>The Witch - A New Career for WFRP</h2>
</center>
written by Oliver Rosenkranz (copyright: the author)
<p>
<b>Description:</b><br>
Most Witches in the Old World live their life as an outcast. Either shunned
by society and hunted by Witch Hunters or living a double life with a public
camouflage as Herbalist or Druid, they have a certain sense of solidarity for
their kind. While many people were falsely accused to be a Witch, real Witches
are very rare. They have the ability to use magic and know more about creating
Potions and Poison than most Pharmacists and Physicians. To become a Witch the
female human has to be chosen by an "elder daughter" (being a Witch by
herself) to become a so-called Minx. The Witch teaches and instructs the Minx
for at least two years (or longer if she doesn't think her worthy to advance
to Witch status), then takes the Minx with her to a 'Hexentreffen' on
Geheimnistag where the Minx becomes a Witch in secret ritual. Witches feel a
certain love for nature and therefore nature seems to love them (at least
sometimes). Most Witches live in remote places, deep in the forest or in a
cave-dwelling in the mountains. Only few choose to live among other humans in
small settlements. Almost all Witches have an animal familiar which they raised
and trained to obey a number of commands. A Witch is only in rare cases useful
as a player character because they normally want to be left alone. But
sometimes, a Minx is instructed to live an adventerous life for a while or a
Witch sees the necessity to accompany a group of adventurers to achieve a
certain goal.
<p>
Witches have a bad reputation in the Old World although most of them would be
quite acceptable members of each community. Different reasons led to this
credit. First of all, their understanding and use of magic is different from
Old World college magic. Second, they do not outcast those showing mutations
automatically. If the mutation didn't touch the human heart and soul, they
accept it as natural and therefore not as a bad thing. This attitude is
unacceptible for the majority of the Old World's cults. Third, their ability
to heal (or to do harm to) people is very well, which leads authorities (and
normal people) to precondemnment which has been fed by single evil Witches.
For example, there is a certain tradition in the Empire to hunt down Witches
for the Cult of Sigmar.

Notes on Witch Magic:
---------------------
Witches do not have the same understanding of magic as other magic-users have.
For them, there is no division between the different collegues of magic.
Therefore, a Witch doesn't know anything about Petty or Battle Magic, Elemental
or Necromantic Magic. Hence, Witches do learn spells from other Witches and
cannot learn them otherwise (from written sources, from other magic-user-types,
etc). Experience point costs are 100 Exp for level 1 spells, 200 Exp for level
2 spells and 300 Exp for level 2 spells. Witch spells don not
differ in their type (ie. Battle or Daemonic, for example) but only in levels.
On the other side, Witches have a limited repertoire of spells of all these
magic types (see list below).
Whenever a spell description states that the ingredients for this spell are
from an animal (ie. here anything other than humanoid), Witches can replace
these ingredients by other organic ingredients (GM may decide which will fit).

- - - - - -
Level 1: Curse (P), Glowing Light (P), Magic Alarm (P), Remove Curse (P),

NEW SPELLS:

Spell Name	: Contact Familiar
Spell Level	: Witch Magic Level 1
Magic Points	: 1 per round
Range		: Eyesight
Duration	: Instantaneous
Ingredients	: twig of an elm

Upon casting this spell the Witch must break the twig and is now able to
send a mental message to her familiar. This message will come into the mind
of the animal as its own instincts, so the message has to be designed this
way. For example, no familiar will ever be able to know or learn what the
word 'sword' in the command "Put sword into mouth and bring it to master"
means. The command "Put glittering, long, sharp, cold thing into mouth and
bring it to master" will be alot better. The familiar will try to obey this
command (because it's its own instinct), but will do so normally by trying to
avoid any physical danger. If such danger is inevitable, the familiar is
allowed a WP test to ignore this 'instinct' (GM may decide whether any bonus
or penalty to this test applies). Each round (ie 10 seconds) of contact between
caster and familiar costs 1 MP. The caster can end the duration of this spell
at will.
The actions of the familiar is to be decided by the GM according to the kind
of command.

Familiars:
----------

Favourite familiars are intelligable animals like owls, hounds, cats, sometimes
even rats and certain snakes...

More to do....
