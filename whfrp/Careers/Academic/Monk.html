Subject: WFRP: Two new basic careers
<hr>
<p>
Here are two new basic careers: Initiate Monk and Younger Brother.
Both of these are oriental careers, as they're careers for new monks in
Cathayan temples.<br>
Initiate Monk is a career for those who arrive to the temple with enough
money to pay for the upkeep while they learn, and Younger Brother is for
those without money who have to work to pay for their upkeep.

<h2>Monk</h2>

<p>
Monks are most common in Cathay and Nippon, but meny secular Orders
exist also in the Old World. Many temples train Templars and warrior
monks for the defense of the Temple and the Realm, but it's also common
to find a temple devouted entirely to study, or a combination of these
two.

<p>
I will be posting Warrior Monk, Monk, Mystic, and Abbot careers later
since I don't have them all yet. They're advanced careers for those who
complete these (Monks _have to_ complete the career before they can
switch to another), with Abbot being High Advanced career - it's
possible to get there from Monk, Mystic, or Warrior Monk careers.
