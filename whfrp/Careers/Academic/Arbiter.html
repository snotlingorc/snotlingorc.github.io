Very often the official judgment of the law does not extend to the far 
off rural areas.  For these rustic peasants, the arbiter is the only 
means of settling disputes.  They are paid by the village usually, and 
are slightly better off then your average peasant.  However, sometimes 
arbiter are forced to leave their homes due to the wrath of people not 
happy with their decisions.
