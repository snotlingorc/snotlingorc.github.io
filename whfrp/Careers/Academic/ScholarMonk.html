<P>
Scholar Monks are academics. They read books, write books, copy books..
Their study may require them to travel out of the temple, to collect
information, to gain some specific knowledge, to learn something new.
Their skills and knowledge may be requested by some high official, in
which case they again have to depart from the temple. Much of their
knowledge is of worldly nature, afterall, although highly specialized
and often better backed up than the knowledge of many others.
But, they may as well get to live most or even all of their life within
the temple, in meditation, praising their god, copying religious texts.
