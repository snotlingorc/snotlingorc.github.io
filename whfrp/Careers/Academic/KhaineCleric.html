Subject: WFRP: Khaine clerics in Dunkelklaue...Skills and Spells
<hr>
<p>

<h2>Clerics:</h2>
Clerics of Khaine in the Dunkelklaue have to lead double lives.  they
cannot openly follow their god, even in Sartosa, and have to have some
ostensible occupation.  Since they are all literate and know the Classical
language, they often become Academics of various sorts, or else low-level
bureaucrats.  (deletia) Those who cannot or will not become bureaucrats
often find work as footpads, racketeers, or assassins.  Unsurprisingly,
they are extremely effective in these careers, and find pleasing Khaine and
making a living quite, quite compatible.
<p>
Advancement for Clerics of Khaine is more difficult than it is for clerics
of other deities.  The advance scheme is as it is in WFRP p. 151, but the
skills required are as follows:

<b>The Gift of Khaine</b>:  Clerics of Khaine of the fourth level who have
particularly pleased the god may, at the god's discretion, be transformed
into vampires upon their deaths.  As vampires, they have all the powers of
a vampire as per the WFRP rulebook, and retain all the skills and powers
they had as clerics of Khaine.  Vampires are hellishly effective as leaders
of Khainite covens, and even vampires who had nothing to do with Khaine or
his followers during their mortal lives find Khaine-cultists extremely
useful allies.
<p>
To determine whether or not a Khaine cleric receives the Gift of Khaine,
roll on d100 and give up 200 xp.  Any result above 90 means that the god
has decided to bestow the Gift, effective immediately upon the cleric's
death.   Results may be modified so that a cleric who is the embodiment of
Khainite ideals has as much as a +25 on the roll.
