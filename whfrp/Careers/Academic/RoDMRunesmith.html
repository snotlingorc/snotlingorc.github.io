<h2>Runesmiths   (Advanced)</h2>
</center>
  Runesmiths represent the highest achievement that Dwarven artisans can
realize.  It is they who produce the majority of the Dwarven Runic armor,
weapons, warbanners, and other devices.  Their skill and workmanship are
superb, so much so that many races covet their creations.  In Dwarven
society, the more renown and senior Runesmiths are accorded the same level of
esteem as the Dwarven warlords and the upper echelon of Grungni's clergy.
<p>
   Those who become Runesmiths usually come as a promising apprentice from
the Engineers' Guild or some other craft guild.  All must be members of the
cult of Grungni and are selected jointly by the highest ranking Runesmith of
the Dwarfhold and the High Priest of Grungni.  Those selected must serve an
experience Runesmith for ten years, learning the all mysteries of
runesmithing.  At the end of the ten years, the individual assumes the title
of Runesmith.
