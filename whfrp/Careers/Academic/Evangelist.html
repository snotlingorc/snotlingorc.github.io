<h2>EVANGELIST</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  <dd>Evangelists are popular preachers, who seek to escape the normal 
confines of religious institutions by bringing their religion to people.  
Often traveling about with a flock of devotees, they hold extravagant 
outdoor affairs with speeches, acts of healing, and miracle.  People 
flock in droves to see a popular evangelist who will attempt to renew 
the influence or power of their religious sect.  Many are also attempting 
to line their own pockets. 
  <dd>Traditional religious organizations frown upon these Evangelists, 
and many Evangelists end up chased out of a town, or hunted down 
and burned by Witchhunters for heresy.
