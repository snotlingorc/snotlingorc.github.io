Subject: WFRP: interpreter basic career
<hr>
<p>
The interpreter is, obviously, someone who speaks at leat one foreign
language fluently.  Interpreters accompany merchant ships, trudge through
mountain passes with mule trains, hire themselves out to foreigners in
cities, aid millitary and diplomatic envoys, and make themselves found
generally wherever their services are needed.
<p>
This is intended to be a sort of generic interpreter career... feel
free to alter it as you see fit.  I'd recomend, for example, to choose
languages spoken based on the background for the character rather than
determining randomly.
