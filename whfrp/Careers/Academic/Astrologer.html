  <h2>Astrologer- Advanced Career</h2>
</center>
  Many in the Old World feel that what happens below the stars, is a 
reflection of whats happening in the stars.  By studying the heavens, 
one can learn a glimmer of what the gods have to tell.  Astrologers 
are people who seek that knowledge.  Recently they have come into 
vogue in courts, as Astrologers seek portents to the future of noble 
houses.

<dd><b>Astrology</b>-<br>
  This skill was published in a WD, and I can't remember the rules.  
If you have them, replace these with those.  If you don't I'm sure 
this will do.
<p>
  First, it's up to the GM to decide if this skill has any real 
powers or is just based on superstition.  If it does, this skill 
allows a very, very, very vague prediciton of a possible future.  By 
examining the heavens, for a few hours, and consulting charts, the 
character can:
<ol>
   <li>Draw up a birth star chart for a new born.  Since the 
Astrologer will be long gone by the time the kid grows up, who cares 
if it's for real?!?!<br>
  <li>Draw up a chart for himself or a character.  On a successful 
Int, test, the prediction will have a vague clue about the truth.  
For a warrior going into battle:<br>
  <i>"The sword of Myrmidia is entering the House of Morr, tomorrow, you 
face great danger, I see blood letting, but if you persevere, Victory 
could be yours!"  </i><br>
  If the GM isn't as cruel as me, he may give genuine bits of 
information of use.  I prefer to snip out the day's horoscope and 
read that instead to the unwitting characters.  If a game is moving 
quite slowly, you might want to use this to give a clue<br>
  If the character fails, his prediction is wrong.  <br>
  <i>"The stars say that the Chaos Army will retreat, if you confront 
them alone outside the Keep wearing only a cowbell!"</i><br>
  Of course, if the Astrologer is dumb enough to tell the Lord 
that, let him meet my Executioner NPC.  Hopefully, despite the 
prediction of the stars, the Astrologer PC would say:<br>
  <i>"hmm, the sword of Myrmidia is entering the House of Morr.  Great 
blood shed ahead!  I'm sure victory is certain.  I think I could find 
out more if I were to go through the escape tunnel, to the hill, 
where I could have a better view of the stars..."</i><br>
  Needless to say, Astrology rolls should be done by the GM in 
secret, and the prediction passed to the Astrologer, so that he could 
make the predicition public after "editing" it.<br>
  <li>If the players are droll enough, they can try to get a "yes/no" 
answer out of the stars.  Let them try, and give them, if successful, 
an amibiguous response with maybe a little clue.  If the Astrologer 
fails, give 'em the wrong answer, but kind of ambiguous, so they 
don't know right off it's the wrong answer.
</ol>

Notes:  This is yet again another fun roleplaying career.  No matter 
how many times the philosophers wrong, he'll be dead certain the 
stars have all the answers, and maybe he interpreted it wrong once or 
twice...  As soon as the Astrologers says: "I have an idea, I'll 
divine it from the heavens!"  the players should start to groan and 
throw dice and sharp objects at the Astrologer player and the GM!
