<h2>ARTIST-RELIGIOUS ARTIST</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  Some artists use their talents in praise of their respective gods and re=
ligion.  
Although not sharing the same affluence and wealth of the High Society 
Artist, their lives are far more comfortable, doing frescoes in churches 
and temples, triptychs for alters, and other inspiring paintings.  Their 
work is especially prolific amongst the grandeur (although some critics 
would say "gaudy") churches and spires. The most famous of religious 
painters is of course the Tilean Master Miguelangelo.  Others include 
the Estalian Hieronymous Posh, and the Imperial Ruprecht Durer.
<p>
  These artists reject the false, transitory, crass nature of materialism 
embraced by the High Society Artists, and the empty self indulgence and 
self destruction of the Degenerate Artist, and choose the safety and 
solitude of worship through art.

<i>Artistic Expertise (New Skill)</i>
  The Art skill of the same sort is necessary to have Artistic Expertise. =
<p> 
A character with Artistic Expertise can produce Artwork of far greater 
caliber than someone with just the Art Skill.  This skill gives a 
further +10% to all Busk tests, and the Artist may demand two to three 
times as much for their work.  The Artistic Expertise is divided up into 
the same categories as Art.  This Skill will also include Muscianship 
and Sing.
