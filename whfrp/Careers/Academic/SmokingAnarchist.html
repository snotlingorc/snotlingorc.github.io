Subject: The smoking-room Anarchist
<p>
When Owen Cooper posted his Anarchist (Mark II)yesterday, I just
couldn't resist.
<p>
So this is the necessary addition for all civilized areas of 
Bretonnia and the Empire.

<p>
Especially in the bourgois upperclasses of the Empire and Bretonnia
there are a lot of idle young rich, who have taken up the burden of
supporting the plight of the poor and downtrodden.
<p>
Their activism consists mainly of scholarly discussions, sometimes
public speeches in the backrooms of fashionable inns, and the writing
and printing of highly theoretical pamphlets only they understand.

This is of course mainly designed as a NPC-Comic-Relief-Career, but
I can imagine it as a Starter Career too. Just think what happens,
shoud the Character loose the protection of his family. Hell be a
member of the downtrodden soon enough.
