<h2>Midwives:   (Basic)</h2>
</center>
   Midwives of Rhya are widely known for their expertise in the delivery of
babies.  This exclusive group of women (mostly human and Halfling) travel
from village to village facilitating childbirth and easing the associated
pain.  Naturally, their reputation is such that they are welcomed wherever
they travel and are often sought out by the rural aristocracy to deliver
their heirs. 
<p>
   To become a Midwife, one must have been an initiate of Rhya for at least
two years and selected by a council of Clerics.
