<H2>Wood-elf Lorekeeper</H2> 
</center>
<p>

Lorekeepers are old Wood Elves who live in the temples, writing down the
knowledge the elves accumulate during their lives, teaching others, and
generally keeping all the information safe. They are very respected and
can't be ordered by many, and have formal status that allows them to eg.
keep a few wardancers as their bodyguard should they get anywhere from
their temples.<P>

Few Lorekeepers ever depart from the temples, but some are come over by
the need to fill the tablets they have, and go out of the elven lands to
the wide world, to gather more information, more knowledge. This they
write down onto the Tablets of Knowldge (heavy copper tablets) using a
script only they know - a script that is VERY small and hard, as very
much information has to be fitted into a small space for it to be
useful.<P>

The Celestial mage of the group who's a Lorekeeper is a little over 1000
years old. I mean, when I said that they're old, I truly meant it. Also,
as a Celestial mage, he slowly gains the mental disorder Knowledge
Hungry (as well as some others), which was part of the reason he left
the temple: there is a large world out there, and so much information
and knowledge to gather.. Someone HAS to do it, less it be lost forever.<P>

Unfortunately I don't remember the careers from which one can enter the
Lorekeeper career, but it's Wood Elf only anyway (I know there is the
Dwarven loremaster career, too, and so on, but all the others are
different - this is Wood Elf Lorekeeper, not a general career) and
advanced career. And of course it's Acadamic career. So, from this
information You should be able to decide who is and who isn't allowed to
enter this career.<P>
