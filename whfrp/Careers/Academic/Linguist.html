Here's a new career.  I know that there is a translator, but the 
career doesn't cover enough ground

<h2>Linguist/Translator</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
  The various languages and dialects of the Old World require 
many merchants, military forces, and local authorities in areas 
such as ports and major trading centers to employ interpreters.  
Many spend time in waterfronts and ports, acting as intermediaries 
between merchants and the port authorities.  Others accompany 
diplomats and other envoys to foreign lands.  Many colleges and 
universities will also employ them, for teaching or translating.  The 
least fortunate find themselves trekking around the countryside 
with armies, acting as a liason with the less than friendly 
local population.
