 Here's a project that's been dormant for a long time.
 Thought you might be interested.

 These new careers can be used to create a more elaborate background
 in the Warhammer world, it is up to you, the GM, whether you want the
 PC entering these careers (keep in mind that it is often _very_
 difficult to enter an artisan career, because the local guild usually
 sets a limit to how many practioners of a craft there can be in the
 area).

<h2>New Careers - Artisan</h2>
</center>

<b>Reason:</b> The list of Artisan careers in the WFRP rule book is "incomplete"
  the text says. I have therefore attempted to make a more complete list of
  Artisan careers. 
<p>
<b>Description:</b> Same as in the rule book.

 Many of these careers are only found in larger cities, there simply isn't
 a large enough market for these in smaller towns and villages to support
 a craftsman of notable skill.<br>
 There are craftsmen who travel regularly from town to town providing these
 services, also pedlars bring crafted goods out to even the remotest outpost.
 In some towns some crafts will be performed together; e.g.  Bowyer/Fletcher,
 Architect/Carpenter/Builder, Baker/Miller, etc.<br>
 In the larger cities there are often a large demand for one particular item,
 this leads to specialisation, causing careers to split (An example of this
 is Carpenter/Cartwright).<br>

  A (*) marks a new artisan career, or a new skill.

New skills:
<ul>
<li><i>Art:</i> Art seemed to be too much knowledge in one skill, so here is a
     proposal to split it into subcategories (almost like the
     Specialist Weapon skill). The first art skill costs the normal
     100 ep but any further art skills only cost 75 eps, due  to the
     overlapping of knowledge: 
<li><i>Calligraphy:</i>  The Art of Writing and Illuminating text
       (treaties, documents, books (esp religious ones)
<li><i>Carve:</i>  Making forms and figures from hard materials
       (wood, bone or stones).  
<li><i>Engraving:</i> Inscribing or indenting hard materials with a text,
       pattern or picture (metals, glass, wood, stone, gems, etc.).
<li><i>Painting:</i> Depicting or drawing landscapes, portraits or still
       life on paper or canvas. The person knows how to wield a
       brush and the right colours to use.
<li><i>Pottery:</i> Making objects from clay, What clay to use, how to
       burn it, colour it etc.
<li><i>Sculpting:</i> Usually creating far larger shapes than the carver,
       the sculptor works primarily with stone, but also with
       molds and casts.
<li><i>Founding:</i> Being able to make casts and knowing how to successfully cast
     metal products. How to make moulds, what metals to use, etc.
<li><i>Taxidermy:</i> The knowledge of how to preserve animals, also
     encompasses knowledge of animal physiology.
<li><i>Thatching:</i> The craft of thatching roofs. Thatched roofs are one of
     the most common method of covering houses in the Empire. In the
     cities tiles are mostly used and its use is spreading out to the
     country side, but there are many people who cannot afford tiles and
     thus prefer a thatched roof.
<li><i>Weaving:</i> Production of woven cloths, textiles, linen and muslin. 
     This is a solid occupation, and with some skill the weaver can
     earn fair wage. 
</ul>
