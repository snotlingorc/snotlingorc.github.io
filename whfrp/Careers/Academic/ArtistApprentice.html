<h2>ARTIST'S APPRENTICE-Academic Basic Career</h2>
</center>
<p>
  Young children discovered to have some form of artistic talent are
often apprenticed to artists.  The artist then forces the young prodigy 
to perform menial and petty tasks, like mixing paints, washing clothes, 
cleaning the artists house, cooking, or any other number of trivial tasks.
 <p> 
Occasionally, the artist  may pass along some knowledge in a
condescending fashion on to the apprentice.  The Artist's Apprentice
does get a chance to help out the Artist on their works.  Painting in the 
sky, the rocks, and other background on the master's pieces, while the
figures and central parts of the painting are rendered by the artist.  Of 
course, all the work the Artist's Apprentice does, if good, will be
attributed to the Artist...
