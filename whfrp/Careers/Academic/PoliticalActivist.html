<h2>POLITICAL ACTIVIST</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  The Political Activist is similar to an Agitator.  However, 
where as an Agitator seeks to change or alter the existing 
order or social ills, the Political Activist adopts a radical 
political doctrine, and then forces the world to fit their new 
perceptions and doctrine.  The Political Activist relies on their 
dogma to solve all the world's social ills, and to justify their 
own misfortune (labelled by them as "oppression" or 
"persecution").  The Political Activist will frequently run into 
hostility from the group they are seeking to overthrow or 
weaken, and see the resulting tension as proof of the 
hostility that the "establishment" harbors towards them.
<p>
  The Political Activist will spend long hours printing 
pamphlets, spouting revolutionary slogans and speeches 
from a soap box, organizing rallies and petititions, fleeing from 
authorities, and spontaneously breaking into "revolutionary" 
fervor by singing their favorite protest songs.

<b>Political Doctrine (New Skill)</b><br>
  Political Doctrine is an offshoot of the Philosophy 
Skill (See Philosopher Career for details).  The Political Doctrine 
is a series of dogmatic views about the existing political orders.  
Some are conservative, other's liberal, and nearly all are reactionary 
and dogmatic.  People with this skill tend to see all issues as a result 
of politics and the exercise of political power.  Due to their dogmatic 
viewpoints, many of the political organizations can be manipulated by 
Chaos cults.  There are a number of doctrinal types, and the player 
with the skill should choose one of the following:
    <i><dd>Anarchist</i>-Anarchist believe that the whole political process is 
to blame for all of societies ills.  All people are autonomous rational 
individuals who are capable of dealing with each other on an equal 
basis.  Politics upsets this by giving some people a false and 
heightened status at the expense of the others.  Therefore, all forms 
of organized political leadership or institutions must be overthrown.  
Not simply all nobility and an royalty, buy any form of political 
organization.  In an ideal state of anarchy, each man (and 
woman-some Anarchists claim) will be allowed to do and act in the 
natural state of peace and prosperity that would exist.  Popular 
Anarchist thinkers are Erma Goldberg of Middenheim, and Mikhail 
Dakunin of Kislev.  The slogans of the Anarchists are phrases like 
"Anarchy and Freedom", "Wealth is a ghetto", and "If I can't dance, 
I don't want to join your revolution!"  Anarchists are recognized by 
their wearing of black clothing, or at least a black scarf, and black flags.
    <i><dd>Autocratic</i>-A Kislevan political view endorsed by the Tsar, this 
principle believes that the Tsar is an enlightened despot, and his 
power must remain absolute.  If the Tsar loses power or affluence 
to the nobility, a weakening of Kislev will be inevitable.  And if 
Kislev is weakened, the tides of Chaos will wash over all of Kislev.  
Therefore any disobediance to the Tsars decrees or orders is 
treason, and punishable by death...Popular quotes are 
"Long live the Tsar!", "The Tsar is always right!" and "Take that 
you Anarchist! <smack!> And that! <thump> And that! <crack>"
    <i><dd>Chartists</i>-Chartists are a more legitimate movement, based in 
rich towns and cities.  Merchants and local elites attempt to gain 
an Imperial Charter, like that of Kemperbad, seeking less 
interference and autonomy.  These are sophisticated movements, 
far from the rabble and uproar of the other political movements.
    <i><dd>Communalists</i>-Based on rudimentary economic principle, that an 
unequitable distribution of wealth creates an equal distribution of power.  
That the Nobility, along with the relgious orders have oppressed the 
common man, and that a violent overthrow by the common man of 
the nobility is inevitable.  The class system and hierarchy of exploitation 
will end, when the nobility, the clergy, and the new class of parasites 
known as merchants are trodden under.  The central thinker of this 
theory is Carl Manx of Nuln.  Popular slogans are "Class War!", 
"The Only Solution-Revolution!", "Keep Warm-Burn the Rich!", 
"Death to the Bourgeoisie Pigs!", "Power to the people!", and 
"Laborers and workers, throw off your chains, for you have nothing 
to lose and everything to gain!"  Communalists are frequently 
identified by their berets, red scarfs and red flags.
    <i><dd>Democratic</i>-A political view from Bretonnia, Democrats believe 
that all nobility and royalty must step down in favor of popularly 
elected leaders.  They believe that all power comes from the people, 
and hence should be governed by the people.  Each man (and just 
men) should have equal power in the form of a vote.  Democrats 
are situated in some Tilean cities, but mostly in Bretonnia and in 
Marienburg.  Popular Democratic writers were mostly from 
Giseroureax such as Jacques Jean Clousseau, Thomas Laque, and 
Jean Hobbes.  Popular democratic slogans are "One man, one vote", 
"Peace and Bread!","The king to the guillotine!" and "Don't 
trample me!"
    <i><dd>Imperialist</i>-similar to the Autocratic view, this belief is different 
in the belief that all the Emperors are the divine servants of Sigmar 
Heldenhammer, and thus the Emperor is a instrument of divine will.  
The Imperialist are often nobles studying at university and reacting 
to the more radical movements in the universities.  The Imperials have 
the implicit approval of the nobility and the royalty.  Many are 
expansionists, who believe in a vigorous expansionist policy to 
regain Imperial prestige and wealth.
    <i><dd>Republicans</i>-Republicans are members of an Imperial faction, 
often merchants and intellectuals who believe that the Emperor and 
the Electors positions should be validated by a vote taken by all 
wealthy landowning types.  
    <i><dd>Solidarity Movements</i>-The Solidarity Movements 
believe in the removal (peaceful or forcible) of all non Humans from the 
Empire, and the execution of anyone displaying a mark or taint of chaos.  
Ultra nationalist also, they are often linked to the Imperialis movement.  
They are often responisble for attacks on foreigners and Dwarven and 
Elven owned businesses.
