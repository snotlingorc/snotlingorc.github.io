<H3>Prestidigitator</H3>         
</center>

For those with a flair for performance, and with the basic skills of the wizard
who turn to delighting audiences with a pocketful of flash pots and a fast hand.  
Most of the time, they are scorned by professional magic, and the local 
population regard them with the same suspicion they reserve for most rogues.  
Nonetheless, they are one of the most fascinating entertainers in the 
Old World. <P>

Many have originally had some formal training as an apprentice wizards at academies or with hermits. Some have learnt from books or the women of the forests. Most prestidigitators are impatient, undisciplined or try to avoid physical work. This is why they have failed to complete the rigorous training required by their former training.<P>

If a true wizard is on a quest, disguising himself as a prestidigitator is the perfect cover. They may travel practically unhindered throughout the Old World and may even earn money from performing for nobles, small villages and at carnivals. Few true wizards do this however as they disdain prestidigitators and cannot 'lower' themselves to be viewed as such. <P>
