Please excuse me: I'm writing because a group of strange looking halflings
tied to my chair and obliged to do so.
<p>
Here's their message.
<p>
TO ALL THE BIG-GUYS-SLAYERS, GREAT-WEAPON-MASTERS.
<p>
We, the halfling community of the Warhammer World, are a little tired of
not being taken too much into account. Therefore, we want to show something
you ignored until now: the Head Cook (also know as Le Chef).

<p>

<h2>Le Chef</h2>
</center>
<p>

<dd>Almost every merchant or noble house have a cook. Many times this is an
halfling. Most of the halflings working as cooks belong to the Cooks'
Guild, a public association of halfling with the purpose to provide
reliable cooks (i.e. cooks which will not poison the food).
<dd>The few halflings passing special cook test are allowed to enter in the
highly respected ranks of the Chef, cooks able and reliable enough to enter
in the service of the highest nobility and the most powerful merchants.
Their Guild, the so called 'Cake Fellowship', has the secret purpose to
help those halflings in troubles. Indeed, this can happen very often, when
you're only 3 or 4 feet tall, you aren't not as strong as a dwarf and most
of the humans thought you're only good to cook.
<dd>Because of this role, this secret association often has contact with the
clerics of Ranald. Often Ranald clerics become Chief (Esmeralda says
nothing about stealing), gaining the possibility to enter the richest
houses with little or no effort (to say so).
