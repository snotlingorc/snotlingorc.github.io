<h2>ARTIST-DEGENERATE ARTIST</h2>Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  The Artist is a person whose natural gifts and genius
have finally been recognized (possibly) by the general public, 
who still probably doesn't fully appreciate the artist as 
much as they should...
  There are always those artists who reject the 
trashy commercial pieces of the High Society Artist, or 
the sentimental and sappy work of the Religous Artist, 
and seek to use their art to depict the real essence of existence.  
The Degenerate Artist often immerses himself or herself into 
all manner of experiences, especially drinking, drugs, sex, 
and a general hedonistic existence.  Only in the depths of 
human misery and tragedy may true art be created.  
Rejecting main stream notions of art, they Degenerate artist 
defies social norms, mores, and taboos, like the painting 
of Sigmar (before the painting was burned along with it's painter
by Witchhunters) in a jar of urine.  The most famous Degenerate 
Artists are the ones who die, for only after death is a Degenerate 
Artist truly appreciated...The most famous Degenerate Artist
is the one eyed Marienburger Victor van Goff.  The most
famous Degenerate Poet is the Karl Chinaski.

<b>Artistic Expertise</b> <i>(New Skill)</i><br>
  The Art skill of the same sort is necessary to have 
Artistic Expertise.  A character with Artistic Expertise can 
produce Artwork of far greater caliber than someone with 
just the Art Skill.  This skill gives a further +10% to all 
Busk tests, and the Artist may demand two to three times
as much for their work.  The Artistic Expertise is divided 
up into the same categories as Art.  This Skill will also
include Muscianship and Sing.
