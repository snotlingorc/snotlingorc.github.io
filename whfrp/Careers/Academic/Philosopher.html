New Advanced Career
<h2>Philosopher</h2>
</center>
<p>
  
  Many citizens of the Old World, after having successful careers in 
business, politics, religion, find time in their leisure to ask 
esoteric questions about the nature of things (like life, nature, 
knowledge, will, science, reality, the gods, humanity, blah, blah, 
blah).   True, anyone can contemplate the intricacies of life, but 
some people have either an abundance of ideas, or too much leisure 
time.  They often gather in cosmopolitan cities to discuss their 
ideas.  Often sectarian in nature, and sometimes questioning the 
status quo, they often find their ideas not neccessarily well liked 
byt the political, military, and religious authorities, and possibly 
persecuted!

<b>Career Exits</b>:

  Well, once a philosopher, always a philosopher!  What's you've 
sussed out the reality of nature, the nature of god, and the divine 
purpose of life, what's left?!  How could one turn to mundane worldly 
pursuits.  Since this is a complete roleplaying career, no list is 
going to be suitable.  It's up to the player and the GM to decide 
what's next...possibly scholar, raconteur, (maybe a bawd, if the 
philosopher's a hedonist...).

<b>Philosophy (New Skill)</b>
  Yes, anyone can question reality.  But the Philosophy skill is 
knowledge of Philosophy as an art.  Prominent philosophers, their 
theories, are all covered by the skill.  One special bonus of this 
skill.  Any philosopher that has both blather and Philosophy, can try 
to blather philosophy.  When used against an opponent to blather or 
bluff, who can understand the philosophers language, and has an
 <dd>Intelligence of thirty of more, gains a total of +20 to the roll.  
If successful, the "victim" is shocked by the keen mind of the 
philosopher, and is confused, contemplating life, for double the 
normal duration (i.e. 2d6 rounds).  It only works against intelligent 
creatures.  An orc being blathered to by a philosopher is just going 
to run the rambling old fool through with a sword!!!!
<p>
  Role playing Notes:  
  <dd>This is definetely a role playing career.  I made this one up for 
one of my particularly better players.  This is a career that one can 
definetely sink his teeth into.  While not powerful, it can make the 
game very interesting.
  <dd>A trapped party in an old Dwarven mine:
  <dd>"Yes, you could say that this is the end of us.  But, maybe Von 
Halstadt was right, when he said that every end is actually a 
beginning!  Maybe the nature of life is a cycle, not linear after 
all...Maybe this is quite fortuitous, I've never been allowed to test 
Von Halstadt's theory...Maybe..."
  <dd>So on, so on.

Other Ideas:
  > A PC philosopher's ideas are radicalized by a political agitator 
and mass printed.  The political authorities are looking for the 
hapless fool-the philosopher.
 >  A cult has been offended by one of the philophers writings, and 
look to persecute the hapless fool.
 >  A Chaos cult finds the writers theories on hedonism of particular 
interest.  Slaanesh followers call.  Or maybe Khorne followers call, 
putting an end to the hapless fools theories.  Or maybe a Witchhunter 
misconstrues the writers work, and come calling...
