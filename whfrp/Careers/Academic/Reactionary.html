<h2>POLITICAL REACTIONARY</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
  <dd>The Political Reactionary is a person who believes in direct action.  
Following some manner of political doctrine, they follow it in a 
blind and radical belief.  Tired of speeches and rallies, they look to 
force for "liberation".  Often seeking empowerment for some
 abstract notion such as the "laboring classes", they will often erect 
barricades, burn down opposition buildings, battle with the watch 
and other authority figures, and generally seek the overthrow of 
whatever it is that they are fighting against.  All too often, when 
captured in a street battle or at an illegal meeting, these "terrorists" 
or "peace seeking lovers of freedom" will be captured, tried in a 
"court of justice" or in a "kangaroo court of the elite oppressors" 
and then "executed" or "martyred" depending on what side of the 
political spectrum one stands.
  <dd>Many, wanted by authority figures and pursued by bounty 
hunters, flee into the forest, and take up the struggle with their 
"rural agrarian brothers".  Others simply forget their views and 
take up banditry.
