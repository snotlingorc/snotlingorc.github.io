<h2>Steward</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
  (As I have explained before, my games circle alot around the 
nobility, here's a career I've used for NPC's.  You may or may not 
find it of use...)
<p> 
  The Steward is an individual responsible for the daily maintenance 
of a noble residence.  He acts as a majordomo, a head of the 
household, a scribe, head butler, and a businessman.  Usually,
 without a steward, or chancellor, a noble house would disintegrate 
without these highly specialized characters picking up the pieces that
the noble has left behind.  Their importance in major households 
makes them valued members of a royal family, almost a member 
themselves, and therefore above the abuse that the rest of the house 
is subjected to by their social betters!
