<h2>ARTIST-HIGH SOCIETY ARTIST</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
  The Artist is a person whose natural "gifts" and "genius" have 
finally been recognized (possibly) by the general public, who
still probably don't  fully appreciate the artist as much as
they should...
<p>  Many Artists are taken in as a "favorite" by rich patrons, who 
subsidize or provide for the artist as long as they continue to
paint and increase the prestige of the patron.  For these "High Society 
Artists" life can be a comfortable one, but all too often one Artist
finds himself competing against rival Artist of opposing Patrons 
or even the same Patron...The High Society Artist is often seen 
at salons or parlors, harshly criticizing and mocking rivals work, 
while being offended when the same is done to their work.  The 
"art world" of noble and wealthy patrons, theaters, salons, and 
parlors can be just as brutal and damning as the real world outside 
that the artist has sought to escape...

<I>Artistic Expertise (New Skill)</i>
  The Art skill of the same sort is necessary to have Artistic 
Expertise.  A character with Artistic Expertise can produce 
Artwork of far greater caliber than someone with just the Art 
Skill.  This skill gives a further +10% to all Busk tests, and the 
Artist may demand two to three times as much for their work.  
The Artistic Expertise is divided up into the same categories as 
Art.  This Skill will also include Muscianship and Sing.
