<b>Fangs of Winter</b><br>
   <dd>Fangs of Winter are fanatical followers of Ulric whose goal is the
eradication of Chaos.  These black clad fanatics dress as mercenaries and
patrol the forests of the Empire, Kislev, and southern Norsca.  The Fangs of
Winter actively hunt Chaos Beastmen and warbands, engaging them in combat
until one side or the other are annihilated.  Obviously, the life span of the
Fangs of Winter are rather short.
  <dd>While viewed as protectors by most in the areas they patrol, the Fangs of
Winter have a reputation of being (not surprisingly) rigid in their view of
the world.  They are strictly Ulrican in belief and have a number in their
ranks who support the Sigmarite Heresy.  Thus, attacks on Sigmarite shrines
are not uncommon as one would think in the northern forests of the Empire.
   <dd>Those who join the ranks of the Fangs of Winter usually come from a
martial career, mostly one regimented to some degree.  All must be members of
the cult of Ulric and have been selected by Ulric through dreams or visions.
 Such dreams and visions are highly personalized, although images of the
Great White Wolf battling some dark sinister force are the most common theme.

<b>Order of the Flame</b><br>
   <dd>The Order of the Flame are fanatical followers of Ormazd whose goal is the
eradication of the Khaine cult and other enemies (such as remnants of the
ancient Kemet cults).  These black clad fanatics dress as mercenaries and
patrol the deserts and arid lands of Araby.  They actively hunt Undead
(including warbands), Necromancers, and other enemies engaging them in combat
until one side or the other are annihilated.  Obviously, the life span of
members of the Order of the Flame are rather short (especially given the
cult's respect for martyrs).  Some of the Order serve as armed bodyguards or
escorts for Arabian leaders (including some high ranking Clerics).
   <dd>Those who join the ranks of the Order of the Flame usually come from a
martial career, mostly one regimented to some degree.  All must be members of
the cult of Ormazd and have been selected by Clerics of at least third level.
