Missionaries take the hardest path through the ranks of the Church.  
They take the word of thier Gods to the unenlightened in far off lands. 
 Braving disease, restless natives and natural disatsers 
their life is not easy - but the rewards are potentially immense - 
Gold, artifacts and treasures; and should the temptations prove too
 great - slaves.  It is a sad fact that not every missionary leave
s for the new lands with good intentions at heart.

So folks what do you think?  The character works quite well in 
campaign (giving a non-clerical route out of the church BUT keeping 
tabs o the PC all the same).  The  Career was based on all those 
films of missionaries you see in the Movies, you know the ones about 
Christopher Columbus et al.
