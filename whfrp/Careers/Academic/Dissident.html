Subject: [WFRP:1086] Political Careers Cont'd
<hr>
<p>
  These political careers are mostly based on 18th, 19th, and 20th 
Century political movements, and are probably not appropriate for 
everybody's campaign.  The Imperial authorities are alot stronger in 
my campaign, so they come into play.  They are useful careers in 
Bretonnia also...

<h2>POLITICAL DISSIDENT</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  The Political Dissident is a member of a political faction who is 
actively sought out by the authorities as a threat to state power.  This 
of course gives the political movements fuel for the fire, vindicating 
their belief in state persecution and oppression.  The Political Dissident, 
once in hiding, will write a manifesto or book of some sort, which 
will be heralded as the next revolutionary spark.  Many activists 
seek the fame and potential martyrdom of this career.  Political Dissidents
 are famed for their resolve and feared for their rabid adherence to their 
dogma and doctrines.
