  The Art Patron is a rich Noble or Merchant, or their wives, who in
their constant quest for status and prestige, turn to the patronage of
someone with either a talent or a pretense of talent to give the Patron a
degree of sophistication.  The Art Patron often throws elaborate Parlor
or Salon parties with all their envious friends and rivals, where the favored
Artist and the Art Patron are the center.  Champagne, fine clothing and
jewelry, and pretentious conversation are in abundance.  The pinnacle of
the evening is when the self important and smug  Art Patron has their
parasitic, arrogant, and conceited Artist unveil the vainglorius piece to
either an envious or a jeering audience of drunk egotistical
"critics".  The piece is typically some form of flattery or adulation in the
form of a portrait or statue of the patron.  An Artist that embarasses
their patron is likely to fall from favor, while a good one will last until the
Patron gets bored of them, or decides that the Artist is getting just too
inflated or expensive to care for...
