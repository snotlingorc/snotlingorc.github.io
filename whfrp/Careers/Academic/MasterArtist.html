<h2>MASTER ARTIST</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
  Only the best and most enduring of Artists ever attain the status of 
Master.  Once an Artist has acquired this level of ability, they are free 
to choose whatever they want to do.  Their work is in so much demand, 
that everybody will tolerate their eccentricities, peculiarities, and their 
whimsical demands.  The Master Artist will often seek a place to work 
in exclusion, emerging only to sell their work for outrageous amounts to 
fawning admirers and patrons, regardless of the quality of their work.

<b>Art Mastery (New Skill)</b><br>
  The Art Mastery Skill reflects the epitome of artistic ability.  The Artist 
with this skill may create new and visionary pieces, immortalized in their 
own distinct style.  Any painting with their signature or in their style is 
worth from four to five times as much as a normal painting, and a painting 
by a dead Master may sell for as much as ten times the original value.  All 
Busk tests are made at +30.
<p>
  This Skill may only be acquired by gaining the Art, Art Expertise, and 
completing this career.  It cannot be learned without entering this career 
through the career path.
