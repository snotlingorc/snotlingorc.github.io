<h2>DUCK HUNTER</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  Rich merchants and nobles with too much time and money on 
their hands, will often gather their friends together and go on 
excursions out to their town houses or country houses.  After a 
considerable amount of drinking, they will get in boats and row 
out to the nearest swampy or marshy area.  There they hide in the 
cold dawn, sitting in a marsh, drinking and waiting to shoot ducks.  
The novelty to their hunting is that they use expensive and rare 
firearms for their hunting.  Mimicking duck calls, or flushing the 
ducks out with dogs, they will open fire blowing the harmless 
ducks out of the sky.
<p>
  Afterwards, many will wander back to their hunting lodges for 
more drinking, and to treat those wounded by stray rounds...
