<h2>Mariners  (Order of the Trident):   (Advanced)</h2>
</center>
<p>
   Mariners are the maritime equivalent to the Templars of other cults.  They
are expert seamen, as well as fighters, and can be found in most large
seaports of the Old World.  Similar to Templars, Mariners root out Chaos and
Evil (such as those pirate bands intend solely on killing) on the high seas.<br>
 They are among the first to engage the extremely dangerous Chaos, Dark Elf,
and Skaven fleets that roam the open seas, especially near the coasts of the
Old World.
<p>
   Those who join the Order of the Trident usually come from a maritime (or
similar) career.  All must be members of the cult of Manann and are selected
by a council of second level or above Clerics.  They must serve at least one
year on various ships performing numerous tasks.  Only then will the
individual be able to join a company of Mariners.

   <b>Career Entrances</b>: Boatman, Marine, Navigator, Pilot, Seaman
<p>
   <b>Career Exits</b>: Explorer, Initiate (Manann), Sea Captain
<p>

   <i>Navigation</i>:  Characters with this skill have the ability to guide a ship
around dangerous obstacles such as hidden sandbars or shoals.  They also have
the ability to recognize tidal influences in coastal waters and using them to
their advantage when guiding the ship through.
<p>
   <i>Sea Lore</i>:  An understanding of sea lore allows characters to be familiar
with the hazards of travel on the open sea.  They will recognize signs of
dangerous eddies and shoals, increase danger of an imminent squall or storm
at sea, and whether the risk of dying winds and a becalmed sea has increased.
 They can also tell whether anything is out of place or unusual.
