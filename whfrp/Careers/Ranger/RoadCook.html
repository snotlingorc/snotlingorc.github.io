<H3>Road Cook</H3>
</center>
<p>

Many cities lie days apart and its rare to find a band of travelers 
that has not been caught on the road with out fresh food.  The Road 
cook has developed to relieve the misery of eating stale rations and 
old bread weeks on end.  The Muleskinner, Outrider, and Road Cook are  
musts for many caravans.  The Halflings natural affinity for well 
prepared food has made them an obvious choice to fill this position.

Has anyone created a "Master Chef" career? I like the road cook, but how
about an advanced career that follows? <P>

Imagine a Halfling Master Chef...yum yum..<P>

You could give them the skill cook (but with a much better chance of
spotting poison etc..)  just a thought.<P>
