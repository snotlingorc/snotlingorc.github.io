<h2>Halfling Hydrologist<br>Hydrologists apprentice</h2>
</center>
<p>
The sewers under most major cities are poorly designed(mostly because of
haphazard growth), old and decaying and infested by the forces of chaos. 
All of these things lead to clogging. In many cases the pipes are too
small to allow another race to work comfortably or at all. This leads to
the selection of halflings as the maintance crews. The work is dangerous
mostly because of the threat of chaos mutations. Hobbits are not
particularly brave and tend to perfer a comfortiable life. For both these
reasons the job pays pretty well. Of course if the problem is large enough
a elementalist is contacted for to use his skill with earth and water to
fix the problem. The apprentices are rogue class, the masters are
academic. The corps tends to favor daggers and hand crossbows with the
strings either enchanted against water or covered in a coating of wax that
breaks off when the weapon is drawn back. These weapons are used to defend
themselves from small chaos mutantions while they beat a hasty retreat
back to the dwarven gaurd who is stationed as near as possible to the work
site. As a compromise between the two some carry several throing knives.
The masters are of an engineering bent and can discuss the way stone and
earth handle stress as an equal with an architect or elementalist and
could also talk shop with the wizard about the way flowing water behaves.
There are very few of them but they overlap a lot with the personality
type that adventures so having this open to player characters is not
unreasonible. For all of you who are wondering why the dwarves don't do
this...they do these guys just handle the smaller spots that the
overweight and underflexible dwarves can not reach. By the way I erred on 
the side of making them power gameible rather than wimps.

Hydrologist's apprentice
Entrances: Rat catcher, elementalist, begger, stonemason, stonemasons 
apprentice, labourer, tomb robber, sapper(if it were possible for a 
halfling to be a sapper)
Exits:
Hydrologist master, Same as entrances except sapper. 
25% of all hydrologist apprentices have be dosed with a potion of 
perminent effect which is a guild secret and causes them to gain +10 
yards to night vision and to lose most of there sense of smell including 
their all of there ability to detect foul odors. Both of these effects 
are consider beneficial by the guild's members. Optionally you can give 
the PC the option of drinking this at the start of this carreer.
<p>
Advances:  WS +10 , BS +10 , S+2 , T+2 , W +2 , Dex +10 , Cl +10
<p>
Skills:
Immunity to disease
25% chance of Stonegineering*  
75% chance of swim
10% of scale sheer surface
Flee!
30% Specialty weapon-hand crossbow
30% Specialty weapon-throwing knives
30% of contortionist(not showoffish but does give additional bonus to 
getting through small spaces)
trappings:

havve extra padding on the elbow and knees to facilitate crawling. The 
waistband laces together so that it will not come open even when crawling 
on the stomach in any direction.
<p>
<i>* all of you who insist on not creating new skills should replace this 
with 25% each of stoneworking and engineering. This skill gives a +30 to 
construct tests when working with stone  (as the combination 
stoneworking+engineering would). However it gives no skill with wood and 
no ability to create decorative elements. The motto is"If it would 
collapse, it is not blocking the sewages flow and its water tight, Leave 
it we don't care how ugly it is." It does give limited plan reading 
ablity, any level of structural complexity is comprehesible but complex 
joints is wood, things that involve motion, decorative complexities, and 
exotic matterials may confuse them.</i>

skills
20% of scale sheer surface
stonegeneering
30% chance of SW- hand crossbow
30% chance of SW- thrown weapon
First aid(first type of use under heal wounds)

tools have a habit of reducing chaos creatures they are applied to to 
bloody pulps)

3d6 yards rope
<p>
a set of 1 to 6 force ratio pulleys designed for lifting injuryed 
hydrologists or large stones. One end is design to be attached with up to
