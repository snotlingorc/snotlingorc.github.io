<h2>FALCONER</h2>
</center>
<p>

While most noblemen prefer to hunt with bow and arrow, they
sometimes use falcons to hunt small game. The falconer trains
these falcons (sometimes hawks) to hunt at the command of a
human. Sometimes the noblemen compete, to see, who has got the
best falcon, and since there is a lot of prestige to win in these
competitions, an expert falconer is highly respected. A good
falconer gets invitations to upper class parties and balls, and
therefore he needs to know, how to behave in high society. Expert
falconers often get permanent jobs, where they have to breed new
falcons and hawks, and make sure, the "birds" get the proper
training, while unknown falconers are hired to train a single
falcon, or to help a more experienced falconer. If the falconer
is unable to get employment, he can always travel around the Old
World, entertaining people with animal shows.

If a successful attack causes additional damage (see WFRP, p122),
ignore all damage rolls. Instead, the attack causes 1 point of
damage to the head and the target is permitted an I test to avoid
losing an eye (+10 bonus for wearing a full-face helmet or visor
of any kind). Hawks fly as swoopers, and have the normal
protections against missile fire (see WFRP, p129).
