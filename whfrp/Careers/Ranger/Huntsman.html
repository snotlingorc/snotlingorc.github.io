Subject: [WFRP:910] Yet another career...
<p>
  I feel that there is a deficiency in Ranger like advanced 
I have created a few of more Rangerish sort of classes for Advanced 
careers.  This is one.  A few more are mentioned in the Career 
Entries and Exits.  I will be posting them every other day.
  <br>Remember, comments are appreciated!
<p>
  The Huntsman is a hunter who hunts solely for sport, who spends most 
of their time thinking of the hunt, the anticipation of the kill.

<h2>Huntsman</h2> Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  A Huntsman is a professional hunter, who spends every moment 
out on the trail, stalking game and prey.  Often they are hunters who 
do not hunt for subsistence, but for sport.  They most often hunt 
alone, or in pairs.  Many are rich nobles or landed aristocrats who 
find a thrill in the chase.
