Subject: WFRP: Another career...
<p>
  Well, those of you out there in awe of my creativity...(there is 
someone out there...right?) I am afraid I'm going to let you down.  
This is a new career, but it seems to have an uncanny connection to 
another career.  I bet you never guess...

<h2>Forestrunner</h2> (figured it out yet...) Elven Basic Ranger Career
</center>
<p>
 Elven communities are spread out throughout the forests.  To 
maintain communication, every elven outpost and community relies upon 
a network of messengers.  Spread along the border outposts and in the 
communities, these Forestrunners carry messages back and forth.  
Warnings of danger, fire, invasion, summoning healers, and all other 
purposes.  Their roles are similar to that of the town criers in the 
cities.  They typically nimble young elves play an important part in 
keeping elven safety and solidarity strong.

<b>Career Exits</b>: Beastfriend, Scout, Wardancer (yikes!)

<i>Notes</i>:  Yes, I know that the career looks suspiciously like you know 
what.  However, the entire advance sheme is different and the skills 
are based on a logical assumption, and some are different also.  I 
feel, that this is a much more realistic career for elves, than say a 
R****r is for the D****s.  I picture a heavily armed group of dwarfs 
moving down those tunnels.  Dwarfs live a long time, and would hate 
to admit that something as minor as a goblin invasion is going to 
make them run for help.  I still use the R****r, but I also think 
that this is a logical career for elves.  I.proud to say, even if they never
published the R****r career,  I hope I would have thought it up! 
<p>
   If this variation seems rational to you, please respond.  If you 
think I'm an uncreative thief, respond as well.
