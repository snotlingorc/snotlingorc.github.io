<h2>COURIER</h2>
</center>
Couriers have a perilous job delivering messages and packages from 
town to town, across country, for military or private concerns. Speed is 
of the essence as they travel on horseback through areas often plagued by 
outlaws and goblinoids.In all cases the couriers first recourse is to avoid 
trouble and flee, but unfortunately conflict cannot always be avoided...
Many couriers are loners, prefering  a horse for company. In all 
cases a horse is the couriers lifeline. 
<P>
Many couriers become addicted to danger and find it hard to settle 
into more sedate life.It is unsurprising then that many turn to a 
life of adventure.
