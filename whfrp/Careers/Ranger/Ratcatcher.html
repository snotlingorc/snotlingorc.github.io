<b>Protectors of the Pantry</b><br>
   The Protectors of the Pantry are Halflings who follow the cults of
 Esmeralda and her son Gangee (Protector of the Pantry).  The sacred task of
protecting the Halfling pantries from the predations of vermin, especially
rats, have fallen to them.  The Protectors of the Pantry are adept at hunting
down and killing vermin and do so with (for a Halfling) a fanatical zeal.  In
other respects, Protectors of the Pantry are normal Halflings and far more
sociable and cleaner than their Human Ratcatcher counterparts.<br>
   For career advance scheme, career exits, and trappings see the Ratcatcher
basic career, WFRP, pg. 36.  Moreover, Protectors of the Pantry are subject
to hatred versus rats and rat-like creatures (including Skaven).
