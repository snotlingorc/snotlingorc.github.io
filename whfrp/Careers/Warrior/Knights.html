Here is a list of new knightly orders I've been working on.

<h3>part 1</h3>
<p>
<b>-Knights of the Thundering Tempest-</b>
<p>
The Knights of the Thundering Tempest are a warrior branch dedicated
to Manaan.  While Manaan's priests represent his will in different ways,
his knights are only concerned with his wrath.  They are notorious for
their fearlessness, arrogance, temper, and a thirst for vengance.  Few
are a match for their ranks on land, and woe to those who face them at
sea!  This causes them to be feared and avoided by most who know of them.
<p>
However, they are (mostly) honorable individuals who grieve the reputation
their order has.  What most do not realize is they are required to uphold
certain ideals which may be unpopular (vindictive anger and quick temper), 
as that is the way of the sea.  They can be quite jovial outside their 
duties, almost seeming to be a different person.  Despite their unpopularity, 
none save the dark cultists would see them leave, as they are stalwart 
defenders of many coastal communities, and will give their lives if the 
cause is just (in the eyes of Manaan).
<p>
The reason the Tempests (what they are called by many) dedicate themselves
to Manaan is normally quite different then why others join the various other
knighthoods.  Many do not come from wealthy or noble families (although
there are some), but from those who interact with the sea on a day-to-day
basis.  Regardless, all have a connection with the oceans, and out of a
sense of payment (or punishment!) take up the life of a templar.  The
stories vary from individual to individual - some have had a close call
with drowning and feel that they were spared, others hear the calling of
the sea and understand it too well not to join.  Whatever the reason,
they dedicate their lives to Manaan, following his strictures fanatically.
<p>
Their symbol, normally worn on a tunic, is that of a whirpool in the air
with bolts of forked lightning coming from it, on a dark blue-green 
background.  Other symbols include a sea serpent entwined on a sword,
a shark with its maw open, and a wave in the shape of a fist.
<p>
Enemies - those who do not show proper respect to the sea, raiders who
attack coastal communities, dark elves (Tempests are bitter foes of these
opponents who often sail the seas), and those who anger Manaan.
<p>
Locations - Their largest number is located in Marienburg, but can normally
be found in any coastal communities.
<p>
<b>Role-playing</b>
<p>
The dour disposition of some Tempests have led some to compare them
to the infamous Dwarven cult of Slayers...although not to either of the 
respective groups faces!!  This, and the fact that many do not come from the 
upper ranks of society causes the other order of knights to look down upon 
them.
<p>
Social Class is = (c)   C  4d4.

           <i>* - the mail coat is normally only worn on land.</i>
<p>
(The High Elves have an order also dedicated to Manaan: the Lothern Sea
Guard.  I have not elaborated on this order yet)
<p>
<b>Adventure Suggestion</b>
<p>
The players are contracted to bring in a fugitive by the local government.
It turns out that the man is also wanted by the Knights of the Thundering
Tempest for raiding a coastal town.  The Tempest want him to suffer their
wrath, and he might decide to surrender to the pcs for protection.  This
could lead to an unwanted battle.
<p>
<b>Knights of the Golden Crest</b>
<p>
Not all knightly orders are dedicated to the gods, or for that matter, 
anything of worth.  The Knights of the Golden Crest represent only a
wealthy boys club who fancy themselves warriors of reknown.  Only nobility
may join, and they must be asked by an order member (who is often bribed
to let the individual join).  Supposedly the Crests will only ask the best
warriors who have proven themselves to join, but it practice an invalid
could join with enough passed crowns.
<p>
This was not always the case however.  Indeed, the order has a long history
of heroic battles and accounted themselves well in the incursions of chaos 
that have plauged the Empire.  At the palace in Altdorf lay the many banners 
of their fallen enemies.  The last time the order engaged in an actual 
combat (without retainers and mercenaries behind them) was well over forty 
years ago, in a skirmish against the Tzeentch cult Changers of Fate, which 
cost many of their number.  Since then, the order has mainly kept of the field 
of battle and stuck to tourneys and jousts.  Why the change?  (see adventure 
ideas).  The cause is probably lost to history.
<p>
Whatever the order lost in physical ability, they gained more power and
wealth, becoming a strong political voice.  Add to this it is seen to be
"fashionable" to be a Golden Crest, an elite honorable (?) order.  The truth
is the Crests wield considerable clout, ensuring their members get all
the best breaks from the government and the social groups.  They are also
rumored to have links with the underground, able to find "special" items
that might be hard to get.
<p>
Their political potency makes them difficult foes or neutral parties to deal
with.  They are supremely arrogant to the lower classes, and openly show
their disdain (which, strangely enough, causes those who are snubbed want
to join them even more!).  As a friend, well, they could be extremely 
helpful... in more ways than one.
<p>
The Crests symbol is that golden half-circle enwrapped by green vines.
Often the individual will put his heraldic device within the golden
borders of the half-circle.  Other symbols include a rising sun on a red
background and a golden axe, with the axe head in the shape of a
half-circle.
<p>
Enemies - none of any importance.  A few spurned nobles is about it.
<p>
Location - The Golden Crests have strongholds (mansions) at many locations,
	   with the biggest located in Altdorf.  They also have a sizeable
	   stronghold in Talabheim.
<p>
<b>Role-playing</b>
<p>
Social functions, parties, and being socially visible is the goal for
any Knight of the Golden Crest.  Also gaining power, normally through
whatever means possible.
<p> 
The Golden Crests are taken only from nobility, and their social status
reflects this.  Also, while technically Templars, they seldom engage in
actual combat or even practice on a regular basis.  They generally only
use any combat skills in tourneys and contests.  What they lack in
martial advances, they gain in other areas.
<p>
Social Status = (s/n)   A   5d4+8

<b>Career Entries</b> : {required to have been a noble}
		   Noble and Duellist.

<b>Career Exits</b> :  Charlatan, Duellist, Racketeer, and Spy.

<b>Adventure Suggestions</b>
<p>
The Golden Crests have infiltrated by chaos cultists of Slaanesh!  PCs may
find clues to suggest this, and find the extent of the corruption, 
implicating some major important government figures.  If they could find
tangible evidence and bring it to the attention of loyal government workers,
the rewards would be great.
<p>
I have other knighthoods (Knight of the Raven, Shattered Oak, etc.) which I
will send later (when I get them all entered into the computer).  Let me 
what you think of the above.
