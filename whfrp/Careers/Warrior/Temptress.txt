The Temptress (Templar of Slaanesh) - Advanced Career
-----------------------------------------------------

   The Templar of Slaanesh is not a truly templar, rather the favoured of
the God of Pleasure. This is the only one form of Dark Templar, which is
open mostly for women. The Templar is (usually) a girl, who seeks more and
getting wild pleasure, and for her no orgy is wild enough, no adventure is
exciting enough. So, imagine a sexmaniac adventurer, who accepts the most
dangerous quests, and only laugh at the problems of others. She is a good
figher, a deadly wizard, and a lover to remember.
