Guardians of Hoeth are the fighting elite of the Swordmasters.  They fight
with a skill and and ferocity unparalleled.  They spend years in the Tower
of Hoeth itself, studying ancient scripts of arcane knowledge about not
only combat, but magick as well!
<p>
Of the Guardians, one is chosen every hundred years to assume the status of
Wraithguard (shadow knight).  The candidates for this sacred position
undergo a series of brutal tests by the most powerful Elven Mages.  The one
with the strongest mental capacity will be selected.
<p>
The new Shadow Knight is then taught the ways of magick and how to bend
them to ones will.

<b>Wraithguard</b>
<p>
<i>Advance Scheme</i><br>
        Wraithguard do not have an advance scheme accept maybe Int +40 and
WP +40.  Their bodies become hollow shells while their spirits become
magically inhanced.
<P>
The souls of the Wraithguard form a living zone of magick around the Tower
of Hoeth.  They are diverse in matters of magick, but only use them in
defense of the tower.  In times of dire strife a Shadow Knight may be
called forth as either a Wraith with spellcasting abilities (as GM
dictates) or into the body of a powerful warrior, also with spell casting
abilities.
<p>
Once in a mortal body the knight must make a WP test at -5% for every day
in the mortal plane.  Effects are accumulative.  If this test fails the
knight is corrupted by chaos.  If a second test is failed the knight is
instantly destroyed (25% chance) or becomes a powerful chaos ally (75%
chance)
