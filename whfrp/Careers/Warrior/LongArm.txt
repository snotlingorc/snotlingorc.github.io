THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW

It seems that many careers exist for the criminal classes, so it's 
time to even the score. Presented below are law enforcement careers, 
including the basic Watchman and Roadwarden careers. These careers 
have been revised because the were just pathetic before.
The Watch of larger cities (such as Middenheim, Altdorf, Nuln etc) would 
be significantly different than that of towns or villages, so I have presented 
variations for both.
Some of this information is based on notes from the Middenheim supplement.
Generally, the Watch of towns and villages are much more 'rough and 
tumble' than their city counterparts.
Roadwardens face greater danger, and are therefore more militant.
Watch Captains tend to spend the greater part of their time behind a 
desk or interrogating felons, hence they do not increase their 
physical statistics so much.
Roadwarden Sergeants are answerable to the captain of the nearest 
Watch, so there are no Roadwarden captains.
