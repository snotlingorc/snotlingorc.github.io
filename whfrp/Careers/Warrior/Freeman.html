<h2>Freeman (Freewoman)</h2>
</center>
<p>
Minor noble families can pass their rank and wealth only to their eldest
son. Rest of the sons and daughters of Knights and other lesser nobles
are called Freemen or Freewomen. Like other nobles they are exempt of
most of the taxes, and enjoy the respect of the commoners, but otherwise
they will have to fend for themselves. Many Freemen become very
successful as military leaders or commerce patrons, but others are less
fortunate, and turn to the life of adventuring in hopes of gaining the
status reserved to their parents.
