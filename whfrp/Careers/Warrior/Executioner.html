 <h2>Executioner</h2> - Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  <i>(Here's a career I'm not sure is important.  Whose going to have a 
fulltime career beheading or hanging people!!!  Most people with that 
responsibility would be soldiers, etc.  And since all attacks against 
prone targets hit, and do double damage, how can you go wrong?  But 
here it is anyways!)</i>
<p>
  The Executioner is usually a soldier or men at arms serving the 
local authorities.  When a person is found guilty of a crime, a 
frequent punishment is beheading.  The noble usually has a fellow 
around who is quite good at doing such things.  This fellow, when 
beheading, gets to wear a black hood, so retribution isn't normally 
possible by relatives or friends of the accused.  Also, the black 
hood, creates a sense of anonymity, and in some way absolves the 
executioner of guilt.  It wasn't Franz who did it, it was the guy in 
the black hood.  When Franz puts on the hood, he's no longer Franz, 
but an extension of authority.  Do you follow?  Without further ado:

<i>Notes</i>:  Here's my justification for the scheme.  A high WS is not 
neccessary to hit a prone target, or kick a chair out from under 
somebody.  But an Executioner, would most likely be the biggest and 
intimidating guy that a noble could find.  Hence the high Strength.  
High Leadership, Cool, and WP, because he must carry through with 
what he is ordered despite how distasteful.  Even if it's the 
execution of a friend.
