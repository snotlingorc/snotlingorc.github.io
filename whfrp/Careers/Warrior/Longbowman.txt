LONGBOWMAN
Longbowmen perform a decisive function in the armies of the Old 
World. They are expected to be mobile, fast, and use their powerful 
bows to 'soften-up' the enemy before the rank and file engage in 
melee. Many however grow tired of the harsh and unrewarding military 
life and turn to adventuring, a venture they hope will be more 
profitable.
