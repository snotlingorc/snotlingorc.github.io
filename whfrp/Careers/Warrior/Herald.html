  <h2>Herald</h2>
</center>
<p>
  The herald is an individual employed by prominent individuals to 
perform various services in ceremonial occasions.  What he does in 
the meantime is anybody's guess.  He probably serves as a personal 
servant to his liege, a sort of valet, and personal secretary, and 
possibly confidant. (but I'm just guessing, I've never been a 
herald...)
<p>
  I'll just leave it at that...

<i>Advances:</i>  WS +10, because everyone has it...<br>
  Ld, Fel, because as the Lord's intermediary to the household, he 
should be outgoing, yet retain authority<br>
  Int: because the lord isn't going to employ the village idiot in 
such a sensitive position.  Also he should learn quick, or it will 
cost him his job.

  I don't think most people will find this career useful.  However I 
find it useful as an NPC and also as a PC hanger on to Nobles.  In my 
campaign there's a lot of politics, with PC's playing servants to 
Nobles and becoming intertwined in the politics.  A Herald could of 
fled his employer because he fell out of favor, robbed his lord, or 
discovered an insidious secret about his employer...hmm...
<p>
  If you do find this career useful, hey! feel free to use it.  If 
you don't I realize it's not going to be a great career, but 
imaginative players and GM's can go wild, having someone so close to 
power and yet so far, and privy to the secrets of nobility.  If that 
doesn't fire up your imagination...

  Whether or not you can use it, please respond either over the 
mailing list or directly to me.  Your responses do mean a lot (no 
matter how critical) and helps keep me interested.  I need your 
responses more than you probably need my measley character classes, 
so please humor me!
