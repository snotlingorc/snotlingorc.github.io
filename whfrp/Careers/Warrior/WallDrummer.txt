Subject: WFRP: Goblinoid career

Goblinoid Basic Career:
=======================

Wall-Drummer
------------

Description: Many Orcish and Goblin tribes live in large underground caves or
  in deserted dwarven tunnel systems. The need of communicate over long
  distances brought up some (for goblinoid measures) innovative ideas. While
  goblin and snotling runners proofed too unreliable, Orcish runners were
  too massive to run even through the narrowest tunnels. Therefore a special
  - still primitive - communication technique has been developed by some
  tribes - the wall drumming. Wall Drummers are valuable and well respected
  members of their tribes as they transport important messages in times of
  danger. Of course, Wall Drumming has also weak points as most tribes have
  different drumming codes which sometimes causes fatal misunderstandings.
  Also, in huge tunnel complexes the drumming can be heard over a very long
  distance by applying an ear to the tunnel wall, but its source is often
  much less easy located.
  In some tribes each patrol 'gang' contains a Wall-Drummer.

Advance Scheme:

WS +10; S +1; W +2; I +10; Int +10; WP +10

Note: This career is open only to Goblinoid characters. The character must
  be a member of the tribe he wishes to drum for.

Skills:
  Acute Hearing
  Orientation (underground only)
  Secret Signs/Language - Tribe Drumming Code
  50% chance of Primitive Mineralogy
  35% chance of Musicianship - Drum

Primitive Mineralogy (new Skill):  [bad name - maybe you can come up with
                                    some better name]

Characters with this skill are able to 'feel/hear' the quality and/or quantity
of a mineral/stone by hitting it. By passing an Int test, the character may be
able to estimate the diameter of a wall or to estimate the distance of the
sound of a distant hit against a tunnel wall.
