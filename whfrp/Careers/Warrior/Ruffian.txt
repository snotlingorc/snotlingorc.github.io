Ruffian-Basic Warrior Career
  The cities and towns of the Old World are littered with people 
who scrape by without real means of employment.  Some of these 
people, known as Ruffians, rely on small petty crime or odd jobs 
for a means of finding money to drink.  Ruffians spend most of 
their time in taverns or at local sports events drinking and fighting.  
Many form into gangs of disenchanted youths, and terrorize local 
communities.  A few turn to more serious criminal pursuits or 
adventuring, but many simply die in drunken brawls or gang fights, 
or caught for a minor crime and  imprisoned.
