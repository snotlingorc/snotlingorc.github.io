Subject: WFRP: >experience & new military careers

And now, the careers of Mercenary/Military colonel and general, as I
promised. Just don't try to tell me that they're TOO powerful - I know
they're powerful, but they're not meant for munchkinism.
The very high physical and WS/BS stat advances are due to high
commanders having access to exceptionally good teachers, and not all of
the leaders will take those advances. Only those who maintain rigorous
training.

Also, I know very well that +50 is more than usually given to any stat,
but we do also give penalties to the skill tests. What would Ld test at
-50 sound? If You don't give penalties to tests, then by all means do
lower the Ld advance scheme. That'll have the drawback of allowing
characters to gain similar leadership values to those of generals from
other careers, too, so You should then at least give some basic bonus
for having been / being at a career where this is a professional matter
- leading an army is probably not a professional matter to anyone but a
general, so he should be better at that than anybody else (and don't
talk about the Emperor and whatever, I know that already).

Mercenary

	M  WS   BS   S   T   W   I    A   DX   LD  INT  CL   WP   Fel
Colonel	   +35  +35  +3  +3  +7  +30  +2  +20  +40 +10  +30  +20  +20
General	   +40  +40  +4  +4  +8  +40  +3  +20  +50 +20  +40  +30  +30

Even though careers are given for Colonel and General it doesn't mean
there couldn't be positions of eg. Major and different general
positions. Just use the career of Colonel already for Majors, and career
of General for any general. Finetuning is for roleplaying.

Skills (these skills apply to both Colonel and General careers):
Cartography
Etiquette
History - Military
Law
Leadership - Military
Military Tactics and Strategies
Orientation
Public Speaking
Read/Write
Ride - any
Speak Additional Language - any
Spec Weapon - Pistol
Wit

Not all skills may be applicable for all character types. Eg. a leader
of an infantry batallion may not need any Ride skill. Also, while not
all Colonels may need Etiquette, it'll probably be needed before one can
really advance to General position, as one needs to work with nobles.
These skills are really not a binding list of skills, just a list of
suggested skills that probably apply to most higher commanders.

Trappings:
Company (colonel)
Army (general)
