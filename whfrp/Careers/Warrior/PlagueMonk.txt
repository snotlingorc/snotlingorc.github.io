The Plague Monk (Templar of Nurgle) - Advanced Career
-----------------------------------------------------

   The Templar of Nurgle is a thing, whose spectacle is so disgusting,
that even the most braves' heart is shaking when they come face to face
with it. The Templar is a plague-rotten being, whose goal is to spread
the disease which will lastly kill him, too. He is the Chosen One, who
live with the disease, and uses it as a weapon to complete his god's
dark intentions.
