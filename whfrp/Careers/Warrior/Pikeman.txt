PIKEMAN
Pikemen are an integral part in the armies of the Old World, and pike 
units are greatly feared on the battlefield. The countries of 
Averland and Stirland are famous for their pikemen, and mercenary 
pikemen from these areas are very popular in Tilea. pike units are 
some of the only units who can engage enemy cavalry without being 
hopelessly beaten.
