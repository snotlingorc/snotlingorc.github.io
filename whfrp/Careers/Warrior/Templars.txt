New stuff (a little help from Rev. Lepper - cheers)

 Modified Templars
 -----------------
 
 I have found the advance scheme for Templars to be a little 
 innapropriate, after all the assumption is that Tempalrs in the rules
 are all of a similar type.  This is a little hard to swallow, 
 therefore I have taken the Templar profile and modified it for the three 
 most appropriate cults - Myrmidia, Sigmar and Ulric.

 I felt that the cults of  Manann, Morr, Taal and Verena had 
 little need for a Templar that was different from the profile in the 
 rules (This is basically that Templars are a Cult's sword 
 whereas the Clerics are it's shield)
   (NB:  As Rev L. said: 'I think a templar of Verena would be more like 
   an Inquisitor/Bailiff type)  This I wholeheartedly agree with...
 Furthermore, the following Cults I considered it nearly ludicrous 
 that they would have Templars (NOT IMPOSSIBLE) but merely 
 innapropriate - Hadrich, Shallya and Ranald.

 MYRMIDIAN TEMPLARS
 
 Myrmidia, as the rules indicate is perhaps the "thinking warrior's" 
 Goddess.  To this end I considered that tactics and less bravado would
  be important.
 
 Thus the advance scheme for a Myrmidian Templar would be as follows:
 
 M   Ws   Bs   S     T  W    I    A  Dex   Ld  Int    Cl    Wp   Fel
   -  +30  +30  +1 +2 +6 +30 +2 +20  +30  +30  +20  +20  +20
                    --              ++   ++
 
 Skills: Disarm, Dodge, Read/Write, Ride, S.Language-Battle.T, 
 S.Signs-Templar, StrikeMB, StrikeTS, Specialist Weapon-Lance,
 Tactics(new skill!).

 SIGMARITE TEMPLARS
 
 Sigmar, the Patron of the Empire, as the tales tell was once a simple 
 warrior who grew to become the unifier of the tribes, the profile and
  skills of a Sigmarite Templar reflect this.
 
 M Ws   Bs    S    T  W      I  A  Dex   Ld   Int     Cl    Wp   Fel
 -   +30  +30  +1 +2 +8 +30 +2 +20  +30  +20  +30  +20  +20
                                    ++        ++
 
 Skills: Disarm, Dodge, Heraldry, Read/Write, Ride, 
 S.Language-Battle.T, S.Signs-Templar, StrikeMB, StrikeTS.

(Rev.L commented: '  Maybe Specialist Weapon Two Handed, so
 they can carry War  hammers? )  This would seem anecessity but 
remember folks, 1-handed warhammers do exist and presumably act just 
like a ' normal' hand weapon does( cf. sigmarite special ability in 
TEW)

 ULRICAN TEMPLARS
 
 Ulric, the God of Wolves, Winter and Battle...  It is in this respect 
 that His templars model themselves.  Physical prowess and to be the
 first to strike is what counts!

 M   Ws   Bs   S    T    W   I      A  Dex   Ld  Int   Cl   Wp  Fel
    -  +40  +20  +2 +2 +8  +30 +2 +20  +20  +20  +30  +20  +20
     ++   --  ++                              ++
 
 Skills: Charm animal:wolf, Disarm, Dodge, Ride, S.Language-Battle.T, 
 S.Signs-Templar, StrikeMB, StrikeTI, StrikeTS. 

(if you note Read/Write had been dropped in favour of Charm animal, 
after all, an Ulrican warrior has less need of the written word - 
reading does not bring glory (oooh, very Klingon <g>  )

 [In all cases I've tried to keep the number of advances and extra 
 skills balanced]

TACTICS - New Skill.
 
 In difficult situations, where cannon smoke and the sound of clashing 
 swords fill the air - it is not always possible to tell what is occuring in
 all parts of the battlefield at once.  Characters (or NPCs) with Tactics
 have an almost uncanny feel for the situation - whether a border skirmish
 or an outright pitched battle.  With an Int test a PC can gauge the
  situation and attempt to remedy the fight.  (this in effect acts a little
  like Divining but is less  cryptic,(though, considerably more 
 specialised in so far as information comes unbidden to the PC)

A roll on the situation should be modified by the following chart...

 +20 Battle is in PC's 'home' territory.
 +10 PC is in a place of Vantage (rooftop or similar).
 -10 Battle is in unfamilair surroundings.
 -10 PC in on the periphery of the fighting and can see only part of 
 the fight.
 -20 Battle is at night.
 -20 Battle is in woods or dense shrub - view of battle restricted.
 -20 PC is in the thick of the fighting and can barely move from the 
 front.

 As can be seen the skill is not really designed for the average fight 
 but in cases of Ambush a successeful result can give a round or two
 of 'free actions' ie getting into cover, sallying forth etc.
Furthermore the results could be cumulative (in so far as to make the 
roll difficult but not impossible)  Perhaps a minimum roll of 5% 
could be kept and perhaps +5% for each warrior career the PC has 
done.  I dunno - modify at your whim.
