<h2>The Dark Scholar</h2>
 (Templar of Tzeench) - Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
   The Templars of Tzeench, the Lesser Mutators are powerful warlocks and
fighters of their master. They are searching for ancient artifacts,
grimoires, and changing more and more of the Nature. They love to mislead
the people, whipping up the feelings of the poor against their lords, and
laugh at the carnage what the uprising left.
