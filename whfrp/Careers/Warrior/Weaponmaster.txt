Subject: WFRP: Weaponmaster Career

Weapon Master Career
	The Weapon Master replaces the old WFRP Assassin career.
The Weapon Master studies and teaches the martial arts.  They 
excell in combat and strive constantly to improve their skills.
The Weapon Master can be found throughout the old world teaching
the arts of combat.  They are usually only specialized in one
particuliar weapon or group of weapons.

	hand weapons.  He must have a lvl 2 mastery of this 
	weapon before studying another weapon.  Any weapons besides
	the first weapon of mastery may only be mastered to lvl 1.

Re-write
Assassin:
	Assassins are the scourge of the old world.  Many noble
and merchant houses use them for political expediency.  Assassins
rely on stealth to eliminate their targets.  They are experts at
poisons and setting traps.  They are not great warriors (different
from original WFRP) but kill their targets when they least expect
it.
