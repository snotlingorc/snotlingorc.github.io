<h2>CAVALIER- A NEW CAREER FOR WHFRP</h2>
</center>
<p>

The famous Altdorf press puts out an endless stream of low-class
romantic adventure novels. These books tell tales of great daring and
true love, and they have a most unhealthy effect on many young nobles
and such. These slightly disturbed young men are called cavaliers (and
by many other names behind their back) and they regard themselves as
dashing, romantic figures. They chase beautiful young noblewomen,
challenge each other to duels and make a general nuisance of themselves.
Always ready to join adventurous group, their bravery and skill with
sword (If you survive as a cavalier for any lenght of time, you`re bound
to have learned something about swordsplay) makes them valuable members
of such parties, if other members can put up with their antics.
<p>
<b>NOTES:</b>
A cavalier has a lot of potential for roleplaying, as they are not part
of the regular army like musketeers or templars, and thus have more
freedom as adventurers. They do not have to follow any strict code of
honour like duellist either, so they are more useful in espionage-style
adventures. They should, however be played as true romantics: falling in
love all the time, defying the authorities and so on.
