<h2>EXECUTIONER</h2>
</center>
<p>
The executioner is a much reviled character, and many are avoided due to 
their morbid career. It is their duty to carry out the death sentence 
for various legal bodies whether it is execution by burning, hanging, 
beheading, or in Bretonnia by guillotine. Unsurprisingly they tend to 
be rather emotionless or sadistic by necessity. The standard among 
them varies considerably from the true professional to the sadistic 
thug. Usually this is a career for life, and those who leave usually 
do so due to the injustice of the legal system.
