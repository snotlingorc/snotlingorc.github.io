<h2>Gladiator  v. 1.0</h2>
</center>
<p>
     <dd>In the big business of Pit fighting, most fight long and hard to 
earn respect and then freedom.  However, this is not always the case.  
The "profession" has become so lucrative that some have decided to make 
more than just a career out of it.  These chosen few have different 
reasons for choices: some simply crave the competition and the attention 
it brings, while others find the money just too good to leave.  For those 
talented and resilient enough, the Gladiator was born.  They are 
high-paid and well respected professionals that are almost always 
associated with a Stable and a corresponding promoter.  Some freelancers 
eexist, and make a decent living; but the real money lies with the 
stables and their vast network of fighters and venues.  Gladiators learn 
almost every conceivable weapon skill, as this is their life, their love 
and usually, is all they have ever known.  Most Gladiators have passed 
the point of being exploited by the promoters and stables.  The money 
generated by the Gladiators earns them unprecedented respect and 
freedom.  A Gladiator would not be there if He/She had not chosen to be.  
This sets them apart from the pseudo-slavery aspect that some common Pit 
Fighters must deal with.  Although it goes without saying that a 
money-making Gladiator would find it "difficult" at best to walk away 
from a stable.  There have been more than a few Gladiators that wanted to 
leave the business, only to find an assassins dart in his back.  Rival 
promoters and stables can sometimes "help" the with the extraction of a 
profitable Galdiator.  This practice usually causes a tremendous fallout 
and is done with extreme caution.  All is fair in Love and War..and 
business!!
