Night Goblin Fanatic
	
	Night Goblin Fanatics as a player character?  Maybe, maybe not...but as a baddie,  these green 
skinned maniacs can give even the most hardened adventurer bladder control problems.  Besides, they kick 
so much tail in WFB, that it seemed only fair to give ‘em a whack at role playing...

	Goblin Fanatics are drug crazed loonies:  nearly impervious to pain, super strong (as Goblins go), 
and almost completely without fear.  They love to fight, maim, crush, destroy, kill, etc. almost to the 
exclusion of all else.  Goblin Fanatics don’t need a reason...just an opportunity.
	Fanatics wear long ankle length, dirty, black cloaks, and carry a monstrous ball and chain, which 
drags behind them and slows their normal progress down to almost nil...(character Fanatics will have a 
normal  M of 1or 2).  In fact, it is so heavy and cumbersome, that characters with S less than 5 cannot even 
lift it, (a S of 7 would be required for a sane, sober player to swing it menacingly).  Fanatics can use these 
weapons of mass destruction only because of the fungus beer that they constantly imbibe...(a concoction 
made from the fermentation of a mushroom appropriately named Mad Cap.)  If a non-Goblin were to ingest 
Fungus Brew, they need to make an immediate WP test or suffer the effects of the drug most lethal to their 
species...(Night Goblins use 11 other toxins in the recipe).

SPECIAL RULES:   ( * )

Movement - The Night Goblin Fanatic only moves 1 or 2 when not using the Ball and Chain in combat.  
(This is due to the Ball and Chain’s immense weight)  When in combat, and using the Ball and Chain, the 
Goblin rolls 2d6 at the beginning of the round and that sum is his M score for the duration of that combat 
round...He must move the entire distance in a straight line in the direction of his choice.  During the 
subsequent rounds of combat (after the first), the Goblin Fanatic rolls 2d6, and again moves that far.  Now 
however, he is disoriented from the spinning of the Ball and Chain and his own drug induced euphoria, and 
must make a successful DEX test to hurtle himself in the direction of his choice.  A failed test means that 
the Fanatic spins out of control and heads in a totally random direction. (YIKES!)  Any character within M 
range and along the path of the Fanatic is considered hit.  No WS test need be made when whirling the Ball 
and Chain...Dodge Blow tests can still be made however...whew! 

Combat and Damage - Fanatics can not be engaged in melee combat.  This is because the Ball and Chain 
creates a sphere of death around the Fanatic, thus protecting him from all attacks except missle attacks.  
(and of course magic.)  The only way to kill one then is to either shoot him, zap him, or wait until he 
collapses from exhaustion and then hack him to bits.  The incredible A score of the Fanatic is only when he 
is using the Ball and Chain...when using any other weapon, the Fanatic has only 1plus any gained by 
advancement .  Further, this A score is how many potential combatants the Fanatic may encounter along his 
wild flight path, and it changes from round to round, just like his M.  Each opponent he passes only takes 
one A, and any attacks not used are simply lost.
	The Ball and Chain does  S + 3d6 damage to each opponent per hit...and heavily armored 
characters are just as vulnerable as everyone else...armor does not stop any damage inflicted by the Ball and 
Chain...scary huh?  Each d6 worth of damage is assigned to a random hit location ( the S is added to the 
first location only).

More on Movement... If after the first movement roll, the 2d6 comes up doubles (i.e. 4 and 4, or 3 and 3), 
the Fanatic has met with an unfortunate accident.  This means that the Goblin has either wrapped the chain 
of his Ball and Chain around his neck or his heart gives out, or blood vessels in his brain explode under the 
strain of hefting his monstrous weapon, etc. To reflect this the Fanatic takes  a full strength hit from his Ball 
and Chain....as follows - 
		the Fanatic take his S score in wounds to the body or head (50% chance either)
                               each d6 of weapon damage is done to a random hit location
Nothing worse than having a stroke in the middle of battling a troll slayer...
 
Obstacles and Night Goblin Fanatics - If a Fanatic whirls out of control and hits a tree or a building, or 
gods forbid another Fanatic, then he would take damage as though he rolled doubles for movement...


	I wouldn’t recommend throwing these fellas into the fray too often...they are pure killing 
machines...I’ve found that they work really well when PC’s are muttering “Oh...its just some Goblins. No 
big deal!”  
	Nigh Goblin Fanatics are also beautiful baddies to use on that particularly pesky Troll Slayer who 
refuses to believe he has outlived his usefulness in your campaign (despite your best attempts to prove 
otherwise), or the player who you discover wanted to be an Elf because of the big numbers involved and 
not his love of woodland creatures...
