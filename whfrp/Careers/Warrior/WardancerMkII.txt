Subject: WFRP: Wardancers:a different advancement scheme

Since Wardancers are thought as masters of elegance and grace, rather than
Elven versions of Troll and Giant slayers, I'm suggestin a different
advancement scheme which should reflect better this.

I've also added my thoughts, in order to make them better understandable. 

M   WS  BS  S  T  W   I   A  Dex  Ld Int Cl WP Fel 
+1 +40 +30 +1 +2 +8  +30 +2  +20 +10           

+40 WS: the master level for a character in WFRP, the right level I think for
the elven master of weapon
 
+30 BS: since the Wardancers are supposed to throw also their weapon, a +30
seems more appropriate

+1 S: wardancers do not make use of heavy armour: shields, leather.
 
+2 T: they do not have to sustain such hardness as a trollslayer or a
giantslayer (who, if you remember, not only fight, but is also very likely to
make use of alchool and drugs).  

+8 W: they do not make much use of armour, hence they have much more reasons to
develop wounds than, let's say, a warrior in full plate armour with a shield. 

+30 I: they are thought as masters of quickness and nimbleness: they do not
only fight: they perform very complex manouvres while fighting, manouvres which
do not call only for high WS, but also for high I.
 
+2 A: the standard for an heavy fighting career 

+20 Dex: a reasonable amount, even if I suggest also to use a +10

+10 Ld: since a wardancer is also a dancer, and it should dance with other
dancer, he should have some ability to follow the orders of the "dancemaster"
(a super-powerful wardancer??? naaah!).
