Subject: Inquisitor (mightier and better)
<p>
The Inquisitor career article written by Tuomas Pirinen was great, but is 
missing something important. Why would witch-hunters protect an 
Inquisitor who is only half as powerful as themselves. So I take the 
liberty to change the advance scheme for the Inquisitor and little bit 
more...

<h2>INQUISITOR</h2>
</center>
<p>
The Inquisition is based in Estalia but have also great power in Tilea 
and Brettonia. But the various religions in the Old world who oppose the 
chaotic forces, have their own Inquistors for dealing with chaos cultists 
and demonologist wizards, but can also pursue necromancers and in some 
parts druids and followers of the Old faith. The Inquistor`s
power is depending on the strength of his organization and the good-will 
of the local/regional ruler. But in Estalia for example the Inquistion is 
stronger than the city-states rulers, and can therefore prosecute, judge 
and sentence any man or women at their own will. 
<p>
In the Empire they are under the control of the provincial states or the 
Sigmaritian/Ulrician cult and have therefore less power and can have some 
trouble cooperating with the local rulers and the local priests.
The Inquistor is a very powerful person who many people fear, and the 
Inquistor also tries to keep this image up.

*The authority skill as described by Tuomas Pirinen. If the Inquistor 
meets another member of an religious order or the military, he may take a 
LD-test. If succeded the Inquistors will prevails.<br>
**A special skill that I also want to include into the Witch-Hunters 
career. The person with the Identify Chaos skill can recognize the 
different chaos gods,its followers and its common creatures/demonic 
beings.An Int based skill. 
<p>
The Inquistor will now be a rather mighty person with some very dangerous 
knowledge, and thats how he should be. Perfect for your average crazy 
Witch-Hunter who just can`t stop fighting CHAOS.Good luck. And don`t 
be afraid of sending me some comments.
