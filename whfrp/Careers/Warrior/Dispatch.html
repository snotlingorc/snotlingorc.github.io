New Career:  
<h2>Dispatch Rider- Warrior, Basic</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Description:</b>  Dispatch rider (courier riders) are messengers 
employed by Imperial authorities and landed noble houses.  They 
employ these loyal and self-reliant individuals to carry dispatches 
and messages to various points in their's or other's holdings.  These 
riders often face obstacles in the service of their duties, such as 
weather, bandits, hostile (political) enemies, and other predators.  
Some riders also work for wealthy merchant houses that employ them in 
similar capacities.  Eventually, some feel that if they should 
routinely face such dangers, they might as well do it for their own 
profit and turn to a life of adventuring...

<b>Notes:</b><br>
  I think this class belongs in Ranger, but due to the lack of BS 
advances etc., i stuck it in  Warrior, and it sort of fits... the 
advances to Cool and WP reflect the drive and mental fortitude 
required to travel wearying paths alone...as for career entries and 
career exits, the whole "is he a Ranger or a Warrior" thing gives me 
a headache so I would be happy to let someone else do the thinking...
