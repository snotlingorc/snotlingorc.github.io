High Elf Great Sword
        The elven great sword is a weapon of great length (up to 6 ft) and
weight.  Only the High Elf Sword Masters have the skill and the strength to
wield this powerful weapon.  In battle, it adds a +3 damage and -20 I.  Due
to its great length the Greatsword imposes a penalty of -20 WS when used to
parry.  However, in the right hands it makes a formidable foe.


"As the young elf lord turned around his fair face drained of all color.
There in the entrance of the cave stood a great elder dragon."
