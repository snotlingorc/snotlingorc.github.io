(based on information from pg10 of River Life of the Empire)
Wreckers are pirates who often take advantage of a trecherous and 
fairly remote stretch of river and attempt to lure boats onto rocks 
or sandbanks. Grounding the vessel this way enables them to board, 
slaughter the crew, and steal the cargo. They tend to masquerade as 
bogus pilots, or set out false beacons at night or in bad weather,
