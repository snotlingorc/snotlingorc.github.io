SKIRMISHER----------Version 0.1
Basic Warrior Career

Skirmishers form a small part of any army, they harass an enemies flanks and
serve as a disturbance, and a diversion to hurt and confuse the opposing army.
 They do not form up as normal soldiers into ranks instead fighting in a chaotic guerilla
style.  They are also used for raids, suprise attacks, night operations, and do especially
well in difficult terrain.  Skirmishers have always been regarded as second class soldiers,
their ranks filled with the men who were untrainable or disobedient, but as of late are becoming
en vogue with the Nobles, every general having to make sure he has "Der Kommandos" in
his army.
