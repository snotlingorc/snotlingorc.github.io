  <h2>Castellan</h2> an Advanced Career
</center>
<p>
  (This is probably more of an NPC, but there could be occasions when 
this career could be a viable option for a PC.  If you find it of 
little use, don't use it, but please post me why!  I love criticism!)
<p>
  A Castellan is an individual responsibility for the upkeep and 
safety of a fortification.  Whether one of the Imperial fortresses, a 
noble manor, or an outpost in Kislev, loyal people to the crown are 
an integral part of maintaining the safety of the Old World
