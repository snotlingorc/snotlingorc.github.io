Barfnoggin raised his eyes as Toejam lifted his right arm and clenched 
his fist twice.  Somefing was up.  The patrol, in single file, managed to 
avoid bumping this time, much to Barfnoggins relief.  This rotted trail 
was too narrow and the undergrowth so dense- curses on the girly elves!
<p>
Toejam, at point, suddenly crouched.  The other orcs glanced around, from 
side to side straining to see something- anything.  Barfnoggin drew his 
short sword, the only weapon he felt he could fight with in this 
overgrown rot pile, and elbowed his way to where Toejam crouched.
<p>
"Wots all this then?" he whispered into T-jams good ear, while peering to 
see what was up ahead.  They were being cautious now, too cautious, but 
the last ambush with the Wardancers had been enough.  Half the patrol had 
been cut down, or had cowered because of the damned rattling.
<p>
T-jam pointed his own shortsword at some point in the gloomy distance.  
Barfnoggin gleefully thought of how nice it would feel to ram a battle 
rattle down the throat of a wardancer.  Then he saw it.  A small 
clearing.  He could barely make out some bright cloth.  Elves.  More of 
'em.  But not wardancers.  Something else...
<p>
Barfnoggin raised his sword and motioned the patrol forward.  Revenge.  
REVENGE his small orcish mind yelled at him.  There.  A glint of 
sunlight.  An instrument...a horn...an elf with baggy 
trousers...musicians?  He started jogging.
<p>
"C'mon ladz.  Git a zoggin move on!"he snarled behind him.  Barfnoggin 
had only one thought- kill elves.  Kill' em all, let the gods sort 'em out!
<p>
The patrol, now out of order, ran into the clearing, snarling and 
hoarking, chanting Git Some Git Some.  Then they stopped.  The elf 
musicians hadn't fled. Some of the ones wearing baggy trousers were 
moving in odd manners.  A head roll, a shoulder roll down to the fingers 
and back to the other side, as if a serpent was inside their skin.  
REpulsed, Barfnoggin stepped back.  Chaos he thought, Chaos could do 
this!  The musicians began to play a steady quick beat in a wierd way.  
Slanesh?  Barfnoggin looked over at T-jam.  Sweat had covered The Jams 
face.  Transfixed, the patrol stared at these new dancers.  Suddenly the 
elves lashed out, running several orcs through with slender long 
daggers.  As Barfnoggin and the remaining orcs snapped out of their 
reverie, blade began meeting blade.  Holding a captured battle rattle and 
shaking it wildly as he stabbed and slashed the insane dancers around him 
he began noticing that the dance type moves the elves had shown off 
before the fight were now being employed to confuse his boyz...
<p>
Barfnoggin got caught ramming his blade into the wildly coloured leather 
vest of one Weird Dancer and tried to smash the elfs face in with a free 
fist, but the target managed to throw itself down and scuttle away as if 
a crab.  As Barfnoggin reached down to pick up his blade he saw T-Jam 
lose his head.  Within seconds T-jam was replaced by Spewbreff, but 
before he could attack, the elf backed away- or did he?  Barfnoggin shook 
his head, certain the elf looked like he was moving forward, but actually 
going backwards- whatever- it through Spewbreff's timing off and he was 
disembowelled by a cartwheeling elf in baggy pants whipping by.  The rest 
of the patrol was quickly cut down, only Barfnoggin was left standing.
<p>
He was ready to die.  An elf, wearing baggy pants minced up and went 
through the serpentine motion again, snapping his body about.  Grinning, 
the elf revealed gold teeth and managed in real crappy orcish to say, 
"Break Dancers Rule ya Nob!"
<p>
Never one to miss a chance, Barfnoggin jammed his left fist into the 
grinning elfs face, shoving the captured Wardancer rattle down the elfs 
throat.  "Thaz okay skumbo,"snarled Barfnoggin, "Git Some!"
<p>
Stunned, the elven Break Dancers stood goggle eyed as the big orc 
sergeant jogged off into the dark of the forest...They wouldn't soon 
forget, but neither would he.

  <h2>Introducing the Elven Breakdancer!</h2>
</center>
<p>
  Before the girly elves can become tough Wardancer types, there's a 
career they must proceed through.  It requires a high degree of body 
control, and precise knowledge of one's abilities to manipulate their 
own shape and form.  Their strange and mystic dances have an odd 
effect on the watchers! However, many of them tire of the forest and 
become buskers in town, plying their trade on the streets!  Read on!

<b>Skills descriptions:</b>
  <dd><i>Bewilder</i>:  by gryrating and moving his/her body in peculiar ways 
and in some godforsaken fashion, the Wardancer can mesmerize their 
opponents.  If the opponent fails a WP test, they stand there in rapt 
entertainment as the Breakdancer Morrlieb' Walks on over and kills 
the opponent, who counts as prone target for d6 rounds.
 <dd><i>Battle Rap</i>:  A warchant of the breakdancers, they rap a little and 
make a-huh a-huh sounds.  So defining and otherwierdly is the din, 
that the opponents must make a fear test or flee...
  <dd><i>Headspin</i>:  A breakdancer drops to the ground, stands on his head 
and spins.  All opponents within 5 feet are struck by the swirling 
legs.  They all take one attack at +1 Strength, regardless of the 
number of attacks the Breakdancer has.  Especially effective when 
fighting Goblin hordes.  Best used with the cardboard mat...
  <dd><i>Morrslieb Walk</i>:  An unearthly movement backwards, this allows the 
Breakdancer to move backwards, allowing them to retreat without 
turning their backs.  This skill can be used in conjuction with 
Bewilder...
  <dd><i>The Worm</i>:  The breakdancer falls to the ground, and starts to inch 
his way about.  He does not count as a prone target, so sinuous are 
his motions...Allows him to crawl under the bushes, in a sneak attack 
on enemies.  Also allows him to squirm through small places as if 
he/she had Contortionist
<p>
  <b>Career Entries</b>:
  Bawd,
  Entertainer,
  Minstrel,
  Raconteur
<p>
<b>Career Exits</b>: Wardancer
<p>
<b>Social Class/standing</b> -
By staying in the forest, young elf "elmies" (their slang for break
dancer) have a social class of C (Y,F) and a standing of d4 points.  When
taking their cardboard dance platforms into towns and villages elmies
have a social class of D (R,F) and d3 points.
<p>
NB**  The new category of (Y) is defined as follows: the elmies are
treated as one class lower by the rest of elven society, but not by
Wardancers
<p>
<br>
<p>
Young elmies have their own gods to worship- the sons of
Adaman-Na-Brionha, Lord of the Dance.
<p>
<b>Grandmasta Sash and Furious Clive</b><br>
<i>Description</i>:  both of Adaman s sons rebelled against the cloying
atmosphere of Wardancer society, yet found they were still descriminated
against by the rest of woodelvian culture.  Constant practice of warped
versions of wardancing led to the art of breakdancing.  Adaman tried to
put a stop to his sons behavior but they rebelled even further, creating
a sub-culture of "elmies", groups of young would-be Wardancers
disatisfied with their own cultural upbringing.<br>
<i>Alignment</i>: Neutral<br>
<i>Symbol</i>: baggy trousers and oversize clothes<br>
<i>Area of Worship</i>: wherever the elmies can set up their cardboard<br>
<i>Friends and enemies</i>: Most wardancer cultists are friendly (guarded), but
the human cult of Ranald are also good friends- especially with groups of
elmies who work the cities.  The enemies are few with most cults and
cultures holding elmies in contempt.<br>
<i>Cult requirements</i>: vary from band to band, but worshippers must be break
dancers or former breakdancers.<br>
<i>Strictures</i>: elmies must conform to break dancer culture, show a rebel
face to the rest of woodelf culture...<br>
<i>Spell use</i>: none<br>
<i>Skills</i>:  elmies may gain streetfighter and wrestling skills at half cost
and silentmove urban at normal cost<br>
<i>Trials</i>: are determined by the troupe leader, usually on the spur of the
moment.  The trials are not necessarily deadly, but must be rebellious in
nature.<br>
<i>Blessings</i>: auto success on one manuever (break dance)- headspin,
morrsleib walk, The Worm.
