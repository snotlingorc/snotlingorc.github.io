Subject: [WFRP:1137] Dwarven careers...
<p>
  This is stuff from WFB 3rd edition, so I don't want any flak for it 
not being "realistic".  It's a career that's probably better off not 
seeing the light of day, but the deed is done...

<h2>GYROCOPTER PILOT</h2>
</center>
<p>
  The Dwarven Gyrocopter pilot is a eccentric Dwarf who 
"flies where only eagles dare!"  The Dwarves have created an 
ingenious device, the Gyrocopter, a flying contraption based 
around a Dwarven Steam Engine and a spinning rotor blade to 
bear Dwarves aloft where they can scout out the area, and also 
provide air support to the rather slow moving Dwarven infantry.
A Gyrocopter can dart about a battlefield, dropping bombs, 
frightening horses, and staving off offensives until the Dwarven 
infantry can respond.
<p>
  The Gyrocopter pilots are chosen from the most loyal and least 
sane of the Dwarven Engineers.  A close knit and clannish group, they 
share a complex signal of hand and arm gestures used in flight to 
coordinate actions.
