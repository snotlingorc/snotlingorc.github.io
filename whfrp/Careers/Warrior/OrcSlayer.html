<H3>Orc Slayer</H3>

My little debut piece to the wfrp list.<P>

One of our GM's used to work for GW on WFRP! Another has written quite a lot of stuff 
(campaign, careers etc) for the game, so I guess If I talk to him nicely he might join 
and share the info (I/we didn't know about the list).<P>

I am rather fond of the vertically challenged races particuarly Gnomes & Halflings. 
Hence I have just introduced a Halfling Orc-slayer into my game see below, most people 
see this as pretty nutty, but why not? If its fun & promotes good roleplaying go for 
it.<P>

<B>Career Type:</B> Warrior (Basic), *Halfling only*<P>
<BR>

Any Halfling aberrant enough to wish to embark on a career of adventuring  
is indeed a rarity. Occasionally such a Halfling gains employ in Dwarven 
communities as a tunnel fighter as the rewards for success are great.<P>
  
Successful Halfling tunnel fighters usually at some time feel the need to  
gain the recognition of their peers in the Moot. Living halfling heros 
usually play down their adventurous lives (because it makes other halflings 
nervous) but ever since the invasion of the moot by Gorbad Ironclaw in 1709 
any halfling who forgoes his snacks for a hard soldiering life to keep 
further orc and goblin invasions (or any of their allies) at bay is given great 
respect. They are quietly given places of honour and are invited out for 
lunches continually while they are staying in the moot. They are Truely 
Unsung Heroes. <P>

By returning to the Moot, the home of all Halfling's and publicly 
accepting the `Stricture's of the Slayer' as laid down by the first 
and most famous Orc Slayer of all, Heronymus `Hero' Haleberry, 
the Halfling has taken the first step towards heroism in the eyes  
of the Halfling nation. Many have tried, most have failed. The price for 
failure is high, as the whole Halfling nation ridicules the poor unfortunate as a 
crackpot or worse, but for success fame and adulation amongst the Halfling 
nation.<P>

<B>Halfling Feint</B><P> 

This is a new Skill for Halfling's only. This skill  is  peculiar only  to  
warrior Halflings <P>

(peculiar indeed). The  halfling feint allows the warrior to use his or  her opponents 
preconceptions of halflings, ie  that they  cannot  possibly  fight  proficiently! 
The halfling can against  a single opponent  (but not another halfling) in hand  
to hand melee  `feint' successfully if an initiative  test is  made. If  successful 
the halfling gains +10% WS for that round (all attacks in that round), indeed this  
feint may be  made on  subsequent rounds but the effective initiative  is halved 
(for  the purposes of the  feint  test  only)  for  every  subsequent  attempt. 
Failure prevents further  feints against that opponent as they have wised up!<P>
