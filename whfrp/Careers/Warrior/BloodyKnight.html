<h2>The Bloody Knight</h2>
 (Templar of Khorne) - Advanced (and usually the last) Career
</center>
<p>
   Clad in blood-red armour, with axe in both hands and bloodlust in
his heart, the Templar of Khorne is a truly fearsome opponent. He is
living for the pleasure of killing, don't giving or expecting mercy,
and for quenching the lust of Khorne.
