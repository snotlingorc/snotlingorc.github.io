These warriors have taken their crusade against Chaos to an extreme. These 
former Witch-Hunters are obsessed with destroying Chaos in all its forms but 
are especially interested in destroying the most diabolic creations Chaos has 
to offer - the Demons. They will willingly go anyplace to find their prey; 
even to the very Chaos Wastes where these Demons reign supreme.
<p>
As these warriors are so extreme in their views, characters must be of 
Lawful or Good alignment to become a Demon-Hunter.
<p>
<i>	Sense Chaos</i> - This skill is unique to Demon-Hunters. A character 
with this skill who remains totally inactive for a whole game turn 
(one minute) will be made aware of the presence and rough direction of any 
source of Chaos within 48 yards. The character's concentration must be 
absolute; speaking, moving, fighting or attempting anything at all will make 
this skill unuseable. The gamemaster should make a secret test against the 
character's intelligence when the character concentrates in such a manner.
<p>
	<i>Rituals</i> - The Demon-Hunter must spend the listed experience 
points to learn the corresponding ritual. The duration times of these rituals 
are all one hour except for the Zone of Demonic Nullification which lasts for 
two hours. No magic points are necessary to perform the rituals but they can 
only be done once per day.
