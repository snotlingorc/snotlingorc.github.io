Subject: WFRP: Verena Templar

The Sword of Truth:
There sworn duty is to uphold justice. They are based in Nuln, and stand guard
in the various courts. They are actually quite militant - `guilty until proven
innocent' is their philosophy, and don't mind arranging accidents for convicted
criminals.

They use the lance, "the lance is the horseman's sword, and our Templars must
be able to enforce justice where ever necessary" - Some High Priest on Verena 
made this ruling ages ago.

NB: The bit about the lance is just to add flavour. Look how the original 
Christian faith has been altered by the various ruling of popes etc over the 
years.
