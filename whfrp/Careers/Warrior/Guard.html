<h2>GUARD/HONOR GUARD</h2>
</center>
<p>
  The best soldiers that a Noble can muster are often grouped into a 
small elite group with the most important of duties, guarding the noble.  
The Guard, also known as a Honor Guard or a Color Guard, are charged 
with protecting the Noble, and the Noble's family.  This is a well 
treasured position, full of perks.  Fine weapons and armor, a steed, 
comfortable setting, and safely nestled in the back of combat with 
the Noble.  
<p>
  Sadly, this happy existence can easily come to an end.  A surprise 
attack by Skaven, a peasant uprising, depradations by orcs and 
goblins, incursions of Chaos, and hostilities from other nobles can 
easily spell the end of Guard's light duty.  Instead of hanging about 
the castle, kicking around peasants, they find themselves mounted 
on horses, accompanying the noble into battle.  Fortunately for them, 
if the battle goes bad, they are often mounted, leaving behind the 
poor levies and militiamen behind to be slaughtered.  Unfortunately
for them, they are mounted, and have to engage the enemy in a 
mounted charge.
<p>
  Many tire of life in a manor or castle, and the potential dangers of 
being killed protecting a nobleman, and turn to a life of adventure.
