<h2>DWARVEN FIRE THROWERS</h2>
</center>
<p>
  The Dwarves rely on many weapons of destruction to protect their 
cities and outposts from their various enemies.  One of the most 
successful weapons is the Dwarven Fire Thrower.  A Bellow attached 
to a Barrel full of some flammable concotion, it is carried by two Dwarves.  
By turning the valve on the Barrel, and hand pumping the Bellow, the 
Fire Thrower shoots out a jet of flame, which sticks to it's enemies and 
chars them to a crisp.
<p>
  The flammable concotion is a secret of the Dwarven Engineer Guild.  
Consisting of a number of chemicals, only one is publically known: 
Grugni's Fire.  Grugni's Fire is a type of spirit, made of alcohol, which 
is quite poisonous, being nearly pure alcohol.  The only problem with it, 
is that when preparing the fuel for the Fire Throwers, it's crew is 
exposed to the fumes, which can be quite addictive.  As a result, the 
Fire Thrower crews are quickly addicted to the fumes, and will often 
drink the Grugni's Fire, which they build up quite a resilience to.  Grungi's 
Fire, being nearly pure alcohol, can cause burns to those who drink it, if 
not hardened to the effects.  Spitting out the Grungni's Flame into an 
exposed fire creates a small fireball, a gag ofen over used by the crews 
of the Fire Throwers.  The Fire Throwers are a clannish sort, dwarves 
who stick together sharing a common job and addiction.

<b>Dwarven Fire Thrower</b><br>
  The Dwarven Fire Thrower is a peculiar weapon.  It consist of two 
parts, connected by a hose.  The first portion, the Fire Thrower 
Projector, resembles a bellow.  With a adjustable nozzle at the end, 
the Firer, adjusts the Nozzle and then pumps the bellow, projecting 
a sheet of flame.  The second portion is a small tank which must be 
pumped to build up pressure.  It requires two to move it, and they 
move as if Encumbered.  
<p>
  If there are two using it, one pumps and builds up pressure, while
the other fires it.  If there is only one, it takes a round to pump it to 
prime it for firing.  It may be fired only once a round.  It shoots out 
flame 10 yards, and any struck by it count as flammable targets, and
receive normal fire damage, d4 at a Strength of 3, and an additional 
damage of d4 for being flammable.  Any target struck is on fire.  It may 
be fired at any target, or d3 target if they are within 3 yards of each other.
