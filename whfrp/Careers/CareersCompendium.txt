He's insane, he's mysterious, he's Joe the Mysterious man.
Joe is a GM [according to him THE GM] and he seems to come up with lots of
rules, so I thought I'd see what you thought. He is strange but he does
believe in protecting the poor innocent harmless snow trolls. Any comments
about these careers or requests for information about the MSPST (Mysterious
Society for the Protection of Snow Trolls) will be forwarded to Joe by me.

or Runesmith careers described below. There are 2 different types of apprentice, Guild
apprentices and Rune smith apprentices, and the pc must specify which upon entering the career. 
The S. lang-Guilder skill therefore changes according to the chosen area of apprenticeship.
If a Runesmith character wishes to follow a Guildmaster career then s/he must go through the
career, although skills do not have to be taken twice.

previous material but this version may be appropriate). Cultists may be of any cult but
bear in mind that many do not resort to such activities.
>Class as Rouge.



Barman/Landlord.

Inns do their own brewing and this might be aided by the resident Landlord. The S.lang
skill changes as is appropriate to the area.
>Class as Rouge.

Watchman,(Renewed).

Exits: Bodyguard, Outlaw, Roadwarden, Toll keeper, Watchman Sergeant.

>The original watchman career appears to me to be too weak. Disarming potential criminals
is a skill that watchmen would quickly aquire, and as they all seem to carry halberds these
days S.wpn-2handed is a necessity.

Shadow warrior,(High Elves only).

the account of Woodies being nice to them etc.

>Worthwhile? maybe not but farmers and rural types are very common. I saw a similar career
where the adv scheme read +1 to S and T as well as +10 to WS and BS, this is better than
most warrior basic careers and somewhat unrealistic, for the average population
is not as tough as the pcs or everybody would be out chopping gobbos and stealing treasure.
>Ranger.

Advanced Careers

>Recently observed extensions to this dividing watch into rural and urban and adding Captain
to career lists - good idea, still mine's quite nice.

Knight.
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

>Careers such as Freelance, Merc Captain and Templar fail to properly define the knight
for any Breton campaigns this career would be very useful. Knights can apply to any race
such as the Elf cavalry or Kislevite horsemen thus making it more open than the human based
adv warrior careers

Veteran(Dwarves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Trappings: Helmet, Shield, Breastplate, Sleeved mail coat, Double handed weapon, hand weapon.
Entries: Soldier, Mercenary, Tunnel fighter, Guildmaster, Runesmith.
Exits: Apprentice, Engineer.

> Dwarf career, because not every Dwarf warrior wants to be come a Giant slayer, and
because the other adv. warriors are mainly cavalry based, plus the adv scheme is more
Dwarflike or maybe I'm just a raving lunatic.

Guildmaster(Dwarves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

        Specialist weapon-Gunpowder weapons.
Trappings: Magnifying glass, Engineering tools.
Entries: Alchemist, Engineer, Sapper.
Exits: Apprentice(Runesmith),Artisan, Soldier, Sapper, Veteran.

>Inspired by whatisname with the mechanical arm, Burlok something [Warhammer Armies Dwarves].
Mechanics is a new skill and will feature in forthcoming material, feel free however to
create a personal version.
Guildmasters are those at the head of the guild in charge of the big projects that will
hopefully conclude with a cunning new invention. The gyrocopter,flame cannon and steam ships
are all inventions from some of the most famous guildmasters, many often sit back idly and
let apprentices do the work and then grab the profit that traditionally goes to the guild
from the sucess of the best inventions. No one diputes the power that the guildmasters hold.



Runesmith,(Dwarves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Entries: Apprentice.
Exits: Apprentice(Guild), Soldier, Alchemist, Artisan, Runelord, Veteran.

>First part of two Rune smith careers, inspired again by the publication of 'the Dwarf book'
Scholarship is in companion for those who have forgotten or those who have spent the last 10
years in the ice caves of the north molesting Snow trolls, by the way I think you people are
disgusting and sick and should be put away for more than the average
centence of  18 months.
>Rune mastery should be in Runelord? well to be a runesmith you have to be able to inscribe
something, Rune lords have manufacture M.Items as a higher ability to produce their own
stuff.

Runelord,(Dwarves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Skills: Arcane language-Arcane Dwarf, Astronomy, Demon lore, Gem cutting, History,
        Manufacture magic items, Strike mighty blow, Theology.
Trappings: As acquired.
Entries: Runesmith.
Exits: None.

>I KNOW. +10 wounds is alot but in WFB Dwarves book, Runelords have, in translation to wfrp,
a collosal wound score, their endurance is due to their age and work at the forge, such
individuals are rare and tend to stay in the holds, so no-one gets to fight them much anyway.
In younger years they undoubtedly fought alot for their race before becoming too valuable to
be risked in batlle and so the combat benefits on the scheme are related to this fact.

Huscarl,(Norse only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Entries: Marine, Mercenary, Soldier.
Exits: Knight, Sea captain.

>Transformed from the Citadel Journal 6, norse army lists, these unique warriors need a
mention. Sheildsmanship is another skill to be described later and deals with the warriors
ability with sheids of large size and how to use them.

Swordmaster,(High Elves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Trappings: Helmet, Breastplate, Mail coat, Arm bracers, two handed sword.
Entries: Scholar, Soldier, Phoenix Guardsman.
Exits: Scholar, Phoenix Guardsman.

>This useful Elvish career combines the scholar and warrior as decribed in WFB Elf book
concerning the swordmasters of Hoeth. The S.wpn skill could be amended to detail the
unique weapons the Elves use.  No Dodge blow because you cannot dodge too well with such a
sword and the I bonus would turn them into supermen.

White lion,(High Elves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Trappings: Helmet, Shield, Mail coat, two handed axe, Lion's fur cloak.
Entries: Hunter, Soldier, Woodsman.
Exits: Bodyguard, Soldier, Phoenix guardsman.

>More Elfy careers, the pro could be changed if you think they are harder than this or if you
think they need more ranger type skills. No Concealment rural because Elves with bloody great
axes and wearing Lions coats tend to stand out.

Phoenix Guardsman,(High elves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Entries: Initiate, Swordmaster, White lion,
Exits: Cleric, Scholar, Swordmaster.

>These guys had to be included along with the others to beef out the demi-human career
options
Mime is because, apparently they don't talk and it would be useful. S.wpn-parrying wpns
comes from a picture I saw drawn by the holy Gibbon, in it, their alternative weapon to the
halberd was a long knife so I presumed that they train to use this weapon.

Wardancer,(Wood Elves only).
        M    WS    BS    S    T    W    I    A    Dex    Ld    Int    CL    WP    Fel

Trappings: Shield, Leather jack, two handed weapon, Bow and arrows, Mail fist, Swordbreaker.
Entries: Beastfriend, Assassin, Targeteer.
Exits: None.

>No don't tell me this one's been done before?. This has probably been contrived many a time
so don't get upset if it's not the same version. The adv scheme may seem ungenerous for such
a skilled warrior but remember that these''Skilled warriors'' are more skilled in comparison
to humans than they are to elves and a Elf pc who starts with a WS of (usually) 40+ will
still be up to a high level as well as the combat skills on offer to him or her. Wardancers
are only warriors I avoided the temptation to give them every skill remotely associated
with their role or devise new ones to reflect their unique abilities.
> Can anyone tell me how these wardancers avoid having spears or worse items being viciously
shoved up their backsides when jumping over enemy troops?
Answers along the lines''They just Do, allright?'' and ''Cunning devices than they have that
they fit by shoving up.....'' , are unwelcome.


Other possible carrers to add; Norse shamen lvl.1-4;
                                    Councillor,Gypsy,Falconer,Iron breaker.

>Iron breakers were very tempting but I realised that if you become a Tunnel fighter and
then a Veteran (see above) then you practically have all the skills associated with Iron
breakers. When I discovered this I was very upset and I am now having counselling.

Reasons why no-one can be as Mysterious as Joe the Mysterious man.
1-Its impossible.
2-Because I've heard that some of you, Yes you know who you are, have been convicted of
  molestering Snow trolls and any attempt to be more mysterious would only harm your defence.
3-Because my mate Miskin seeks out those who try to be more mysterious than is advisable
and then he sits on them-I thought that would scare you.
