<b>Order of the Ravening Pack</b><br>
   <dd>Members of the Order of the Ravening Pack are followers of Ulric.  They
travel the countryside vehemently speaking out against the influence of Chaos
that they see permeate modern society.  The Ravening Pack can be found
throughout the Empire, Kislev, and southern Norsca.  At times, they will even
accompany a band of the Fangs of Winter (Fanatics).  A sizable number of the
Ravening Pack still continue to feed the flames of the Sigmarite Heresy, even
though such doctrine was outlawed by the Cult hierarchy over 200 years ago.

<b>Rabble Rousers</b><br>
   <dd>Rabble Rousers travel from city to city, large town to large town,
speaking out against the authorities who oppress the downtrodden masses.
 Their oratory usually enflame their audience into rioting mobs, especially
if the authorities attempt to silence the demagogues.  These riots also serve
the purpose of providing cover for other followers of Ranald who lead the
subsequent looting.  In the mass confusion of the riots, the Rabble Rouser
frequently get away to turn up another day in another city.  Rabble Rousers
tend to follow the aspect of Ranald the Protector.
