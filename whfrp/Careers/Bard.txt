The Bard

[Editors Note:  The following is Ben Hudgins' bard character class for Warhammer.  After that is a posting to the warhammer list with criticisms and suggested changes. My personal view is that they should be on a similar kind of level to the Alchemist career class, except with more of an individual flavour.  It is certainly too powerful at the moment.  The bard is not merely a wizard who can sing - the spells are weaved using the songs themselves.  This will also make the casting time significantly longer.]

[There will be two more versions of the Bard character class to be posted in the near future]

	Having been inspired by an ancient rec.games.frp article touting the
joys of bards and such, I succumbed to my creative instinct and thusly the
advance class of Bard has come about (for WHRP).

Notes: Bards must first progress through the Minstrel career (taking all
 skills and advances; note that non-elves must start with Entertainer -
 Troubadour before becoming Minstrels, although they do not have to take
 all advance and skills before advancing to Minstrel). Once they become
 Bards, to advance in level they must take all skills and advances, along
 with at least two mystic songs of their current level. Level advances cost
 100 EP as usual.
 
 
Mystic Songs - Level 1
----------------------
Awaken
 Magic Point Cost: 1
 Range: 100 yards
 Duration: instantaneous
 Singing Time: 1 round

 Range: 10 yards
 Duration: special
 Singing Time: 1 round
 
  This song effects only one creature at a time, specified by the bard. The
 target must make both a successful magic test and WP test or be allied with
 the bard for a number of turns equal to the amount that the target failed the
 test by (magic or WP, depending which is worse).
 
Disharmonic Blast I
 Magic Point Cost: 2
 Range: 48 yards
 Duration: instantaneous
 Singing Time: 1 round
 
  The bard must specify a target. Unless the target makes a successful magic
 test, it will suffer 1d10 wounds at Strength 2. A successful test will halve
 this damage.
 
Lullaby
 Magic Point Cost: 2
 Range: 20 yards
 Duration: 1/2 hour per level
 Singing Time: 2 rounds
 
  Anyone within the area of effect of this spell (except the bard) must make a

 however: the difference between the bard's Fel and the victim's WP.
 
Reveal Magic
 Magic Point Cost: 2
 Range: 10 yards
 Duration: instantaneous
 Singing Time: 2 rounds
 
  When the bard completes this song, all magic items within the range will

 sing, this glow will stop. Note that only magic items will glow, while magic
 using creatures and other spell casters will not.
 
Song of Battle I
 Magic Point Cost: 2
 Range: 20 yards
 Duration: as long as the bard sings

 during this spell or the bonus ceases.
 
Song of Courage I
 Magic Point Cost: 1

 the spell.

 just one, whereas the WP tests of the two targets will be unmodified.
 
Disharmonic Blast II
 Magic Point Cost: 4
 Range: 48 yards
 Duration: instantaneous
 Singing Time: 1 round
 
  This spell is a more powerful version of Disharmonic Blast I, causing 1d10

 halves the damage.

 Duration: 2d6 rounds per level
 Singing Time: 1 round
 
  This song effects a specific target within the range of the spell. The target
 must make a successful WP test or suffer the effects of a Steal Mind spell for
 the duration of the spell. The victim will also suffer amnesia, forgetting all

  This song will animate all the underbrush within the range of the spell.
 These plants will obey the bard, attacking his or her opponents. This plant
 beast has 5 attacks per round, attacking with a WS of 33. Hits cause damage at
 Strength 3. The plants cannot be destroyed, but will be held at bay by fire.

Notes on Mystic Songs: All of the appropriate spells above have a circular area
 of effect centered on the bard, the circle having a radius equal to the range 
 of the spell. This reflects the auditory aspect of Mystic Songs. Note also
 the bard must have an instrument to cast these spells and must be able to sing
 also. A gagged bard is no good. Neither is one with his hands tied behind his
 back (ever try to play a lute with your toes?).
 
  Also, the spells above are mostly combat oriented. I am sure that others can
 be created for the more non-martial aspects of the bard profession (such as
 something that makes listeners more...receptive to suggestion).
 
  Some may think that the bard is too powerful a career, but the class is 
 tailored to my interpretation of the Old World, where magic using folk are few
 and far between and all kick butt.
 
  Feel free to make any mods you want, but gimme credit if ya would. I'm a vain
 type of fellow.
 
  Also, please excuse any typos or no-nos anywhere in this material. I was in a
 hurry.

The spells of the bard posted remind me of a the spells of a character class
similar to a bard in an ADnD offshot. Anyway, I had the feeling that the
career posted was made up from WHFRP skills and ADnD spells. The ADnD of
version of a rogue/spellcaster blend seems to have influenced the concept
strongly. Normally, a character would have to go through (and survive) two
fully different career paths to have the advantages of both.


On the advance system: +40 on both Fellowship and Leadership? If memory serves
+40 Ld was reserved for the Mercenary Captain and +40 Fel for the Demagogue.
There is no advance in Toughness, 1 wound more than that of a spellcaster of
a similar level, and quite a lot of advances in personal statistics. The WS
and BS skill advances imply that this is rather a crossover from a fighter-
spellcaster than - well, for instance - a just more secular druid.
Believe me, I once had a character with 71 Fel after going through Power Behind
The Throne, and it has been a nuisance.  Together with Seduction, Charm, Wit,
and Etiquette it added up to  a total Fellowship roll of 111. Critical success
on a roll of 81 or lower. I don't play that character anymore.

Skills:
I wonder what Acting and Mimic in the skill list are for. And I do miss History
and Genealogy (or heraldry) when I compare it to the historical filids.
Read/Write Music is fine.

Magic points: 4d4 for Elves only and 2d4 for other races? Either 4d4 for humans
misses by accident or it is an attempt to unbalance the game and push the
Elves.
Honestly, apart from that the disadvantages of Elves or rarely enforced, the
combination of spells, advances, and an Elven profile are a powergamer's wet
dream.

For instance disharmonic blast 1d10 Wounds at Strength 2. Roll 1d10 1d6 damage
and add 2, or is it 1d10+2? Does armour protect? The first version is quite
likely to blow even an advanced charcter to shreds (in a first level non
specialist spellcasting career boosted by some neato rogue abilities? Wow, er,
bleech) and even the second version is too powerful if it can bypass armour.
And where is the idea of using it only for magical attacks that work like
Strike To Stun?
And of course, we have a more powerful version of the sleep spell than that of
a similar magic career. And strong healing magic is included too. The most
powerful healing spell used to give 1d10 wounds back to a character, but now
everything in the area of effect is INSTANTLY (oh my god) cured for 2d6+3.
IMO, that is the worst violation of the WHFRP concept or what I think it could
be that I have seen.
For 'balance', the summoning skills exceed that of a druid, and are on a par
with that of a Necromancer or Demonologist WITHOUT any of the disadvantages of
the these.
Has anyone ever seen an evil wizard proceed beyond second level? If so, contact
me.


Am I wrong or does the Bard need only an instrument (as opposed to a magic
instrument) to be able to use his spells? Anyway, the casting time for most
spells is too short for my idea of music based magic. Nor are the effects
subtle enough. This is a straightforward boost on the wizards careers. The
Warhammer Careers are indeed unbalanced, and spellcasters are among the most
powerful, but even specialist wizards have to go at great lengths to find a
teacher (fully left out for the bard) and have to blow out 200xlevel exp for
getting to the next level. I assume our Bard just spends 100...
And the spellpoint cost is so low that it makes me cry.

The Warhammer World is quite balanced, but with this kind of charming, spell-
casting rogue leader, Bards would rule.

Let's come to my own idea of them. Bard is related to a Druid like an Alchemist
to a Wizard. This means an advance scheme simliar to that of a priest, some of
the more academic or theologic skills exchanged with musical or social skills -
like Scroll Lore becomes History (oral). Human bards should be followers of the
Old Faith, Elves and Hobbits should have special gods for it. The Initiate
stage would be quite like that of a Ministrel. Magic points (2d8) and Magic
be available from level 2 upwards, with spells similar to that of a druid of
Level-1. Restrictions would be a behavior like you would expect from a mix
of a druid and a priest of Verena (or whatshername?).

Exits would include the Seer.

But, Clays way of going through the careers of a Ministrel and a Druid is the
best one for playing, IMO.
