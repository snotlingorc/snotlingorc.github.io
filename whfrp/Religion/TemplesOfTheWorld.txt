Subject: WFRP: Temples of the Old World

Note that this list contains only a few examples. When I asked for
example temples where my character could've learnt and lived, I asked
for close-combat/martial art oriented examples, and thus this list
contains NO archery temples although there are several.

If there are skills You want to know more about and don't want to make
up, ask. But ask specifically.. I don't have the slightest idea of what
skills are in the Rulebook as I don't own it. I have descriptions of
only 98 skills, 15 Warrior Powers, and 16 Spec Weapon skills, although
the count rises on slow pace as I get new skill descriptions to add to
the list.
