<I>Notes:  Comparing this to the Ogre in the book, the PC version will
suffer.  I'm acting under the assumption that the Ogre in the book
has had a career or two.  This allows the Ogre PC to be weaker and a
little more tolerable.<br>
M: I really lowered this.  I couldn't abide by the original M score.
It really seemed like a mechanism left over from WFB...
W: Lowered a lot.  So the PC won't just wade into combat.
<ul>
  <li> Lowered by one.  To keep the PC under control.  Assume that NPC
ogres have gone through relevant Ogrish careers and gained 2 A.
All the Profiles:  Most have +2d5.  This causes slightly lower stats
than the standard Ogre.  Hopefully these will rise through career
advances.  Unconventional, but I felt there should be less variance
among Ogres than the rest of the PC's...

<b>Keeping the Ogre in Check</b><br>
<p>
  First, Ogres must eat at least 5 times as much as another PC.
Clothes, equipment must cost at least as much, if purchased from
humans.  Outside the Empire, they're perceived as monsters.  Inside
the Empire, only at cities with a strong military presence are they
even tolerated.  No lodging in most inns or taverns.  No horses.
River travel difficult.  Discrimination.  Even cities where they are
tolerated, the tax for them to enter is roughly about ten times the
normal amount, and all weapons and armor will be temporarily
confiscated by the militia/watch at the gates.
  Where they are tolerated:  By a few adventuring bands, most
mercenary bands, and a few feudal armies, and also some parts of
Norsca.  If attached to respected groups, an people will take
accountability for the Ogres actions, a lot of restrictions will be
removed by local authorities, and the Ogre will be treated as almost
human.<br>
  No Dungeons. No sewers, no secret exits, no small buildings.  A lot
of normal activities become difficult.<br>
  Hell, this sounds like a challenge.  I might just let one of my
players play this race.  For a good player, it could turn into a
memorable class.<br>
  Note that all the restrictions, really make power gaming difficult.
Also note that a 10% chance of Very Strong and Very Resilient make
the Ogre a formidible opponent in combat.
