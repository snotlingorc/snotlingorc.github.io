<h2>Centaurs in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay<br>
by Eric Oppen</h2>


</center>
<p>
        Nobody really knows the origins of the Centaurs, or
"half-horses" as they prefer to be called.  At first glance, they
appear to be no more than an unusually stable form of Beastman,
and one theory says that they may well be originally creatures of
Chaos, like the Pegasi.  Another theory, defended in his doctoral
thesis by Leopold of Nuln, states that the Centaurs were an Old
Slann experiment that happened to survive.  The Centaurs
themselves prefer this theory, and deeply resent people
confounding them with Beastmen or other creatures of Chaos.

<p>
        Today, Centaurs are found in the valleys of the mountains
throughout the Old World, and in various other places, such as
the steppes or the Arabian desert.  They usually have friendly
relations with the "two-leggers" living nearby, but want little
to do with strange two-leggers; too many of them assume that any
centaur is a Beastman for Centaurs to be other than uncomfortable
with them.  Outside of their valleys, they often work as porters
or traders in livestock.

<p>
<b>Physique:</b>  A centaur resembles a human from the waist up.  This
"skin-end" generally looks much like the humans nearby, and they
usually wear clothes and hats of the same style as the local
humans.  From the waist down, they resemble a well-formed riding
horse, except that they are only seven hands or so high at the
withers.  They are usually no taller than typical Humans, but are
much stronger for their size.  Almost any centaur can beat a
"two-legger" in a fight or a contest of strength.

<p>
<b>Alignment:</b>  Good, Neutral or Evil.  Most are Neutral.  The few
evil centaurs usually leave their valleys to prey on the
two-leggers.

<p>
<b>Society:</b>  Centaurs are almost all rural; they find two-legger
cities constricting, and most underground delvings even more so.
The majority are farmers and herdsmen, living in their valleys
along with "two-leggers" who provide services that they
themselves cannot.  For the most part, centaurs are vegetarian;
they are almost unable to digest meat.
<p>
        Centaurs are religious, almost all of them following Taal
and Rhya.  They are respectful of the Old Faith, and retain
priests of Morr among themselves to tend to their dead, but other
religions almost do not occur among them.  They are hostile to
all Chaos cults, but reserve special loathing for followers and
creatures of Khorne, the Blood God.   For their part, creatures
and followers of Khorne are subject to hatred of centaurs.
<p>
        Despite being very civilized, centaurs retain a great
deal of horse behavior.  They also have a lot of body-language in
common with horses; any centaur with the Train Animal (horse)
skill has a 10% bonus for success on any given attempt.  A young
stallion will eventually challenge his father for dominance, if
his father is still alive.  Once the young stallion has beaten
his father in a fair fight, he is considered to be of an age to
marry.  Female centaurs (mares) go into heat as horses do;
courting season sees many fights between young stallions and
their fathers.
<p>
        Leadership of villages or valleys is usually by election,
but the vote usually goes to the strongest, smartest stallion in
the bunch; losing a fight on the day of an election ensures loss
of the election.  Given that a lot of beer is consumed on the
election day, and given that a lot of personalities get discussed
very frankly and freely during the election process, the chance
of a brawl is pretty high.
<p>
        Centaurs very seldom follow military careers; this is
because the smell of others' blood makes them ill (must save vs.
Cl to avoid).  They also are easily startled, (must save vs. Cl
to avoid) and when startled, are prone to panic and running.
However, being smarter than horses, they can choose the direction
they run, and sometimes can use fear deliberately to get
themselves to charge enemies.  Many centaurs also suffer from
claustrophobia.
<p>
        All centaurs have extremely keen smell and hearing, and
can follow a trail if one is there and no more than three days
old.

<h3>Centaur PCs:</h3>

<p>
        If a GM allows, a centaur may be a PC.  They are
restricted in career entry as follows:  They may not follow any
career that involves prolonged stays underground, or any career
that involves crewing on boats or ships.

<p>
        Prohibited Skills:  Concealment Urban, Disguise,  River
Lore, Row, Sailing, Scale Sheer Surface.

<p>
        Automatic Skills:  All centaurs have Acute Hearing,
Flee!, Fleet-Footed, Follow Trail, Night Vision (20 yards), and
Silent Move Rural.  Any centaur may acquire Frenzied Attack at
any time.

<p>
*Centaur "nobility" are usually members of the wealthiest
families in their valleys; only very rarely are centaurs ennobled
by two-legger rulers.
<p>
+Servant, in centaur society, includes anybody working for wages
indoors around a farm.
<p>
**Centaur coachmen do not ride the coach themselves; instead
they trot alongside, guiding the horses.  Since this frees up
more space for passengers, guards and cargo, they are in demand
among coaching companies.
<p>
***Centaur thieves may only specialize as follows: General Thief,
Clipper, Embezzler or Pickpocket.
<p>
****Centaur wizards' apprentices get 1d4 magic points, and 2d4
per level of wizardry they later attain.
