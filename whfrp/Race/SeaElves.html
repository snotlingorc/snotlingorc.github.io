  'The warm breeze carried the smell of the sea across the deck as the ship
gently coasted through the warm, dark night of the ocean. Galleos looked up
into the sky, it was clear and moonless. The runes of Rota-Himmel, spirit
friend of the Sea Elves, shone down upon the world, revealing the way. He
thanked his friend for her help, and looked ahead. Across the water he
could see the welcoming lights of Merrantalla, the sea elven port city of
Lustria. He called to those upon the deck and many walked to the railings
and watched as they approached their home.'
<p>
<b>_Sea Elf Culture_</b>
<p>
   Sea Elves are the most tolerant branch of the elven race. To the other
types of elves they are thought of as warriors, the military might upon the
sea. This is only part of the truth, they are also the main contact between
humanity and the Elven Kingdoms; in essence, ambassadors of the elven
world. As a sub race they are a very distinct group. Physically they look
similar to wood or high elves, the only visible difference is their more
compact limbs. Differences in regard to their mentality are much more
pronounced. They spend as much of their lives travelling as not, and the
home port of a sea elf will often be part of a human city, both factors
force a cultural mix. It is this mix with humanity which has diluted the
elven perspective of sea elves. Sometimes they seem all too human.
<p>
   Close proximity to humans has caused two important changes in the sea
elven outlook. They are no longer complacent, their culture not static, in
contrast to the lives led by other elves. They have adapted to a human
rhythm; although they still hold some elven views of time, they regret a
lost day as a lost opportunity. The other change is the waning of the
natural elven cool. Compared to wood or high elves, those of the sea are
quite moody.
<p>
   Sea elves have readily accepted lodging with humans because of its
convenience. Their good treatment by their hosts encourages good relations
between the races. Now, as colonisation slows, sea elves concentrate on
keeping the waterways of the world open and working for themselves. Sea
elven culture is based upon four foundation stones: the clan, sea, military
and trade.
<p>
<b>_The Clan_</b>
<p>
   The clan is the basic social block of any sea elf community. All clans
have their origins in Ulthuan. Should a clan grow too large for Ulthuan it
boards a huge clan-ship, the largest seagoing ship constructed by the
elves, and leaves to find a new home. When the new home is chosen, the
clan-ship is beached. The ship can carry up to six thousand and will form
the nucleus of the port. Should the clan elect to settle in an established
port, they will ask the local authorities for permission to take a section
of the city for themselves - many Old World ports have a thriving sea elf
quarter. The new port becomes the clan's base of operations for all things
but war.
<p>
   The structure of the clan is determined by lineage, which also dictates
likely careers and status for individuals. The only position in the clan
not determined by birth is that of the Elder. The Elder is the head of the
clan, in charge of the merchant fleet in times of crisis or war (in which
the fleet can be made battle ready within a day) and he runs the day to day
business of the Port. The Elder is Elected at a Full Clan meeting called
the Konveniporio (literally, meeting for all) held every century or on
the death of an Elder. If a sea elf misses his clans Konveniporio he must
be pardoned by the elected Elder, else live in Shame. Loyalty is a very
important facet of clan life, any sea elf would willingly die for its clan,
few exceptions exist.
<p>
<b>_The Sea_</b>
<p>
   The importance of the sea is as obvious as it is misunderstood. Although
other elves realise its importance, they do not know the depth of the raw
feelings that sea elves have for the sea and their respect for it. Humans
misunderstand more than they understand of this. The majority of sea elves
follow Mathlann, god of the seas. All respect him and worship him or his
kin, the spirit friends.
<p>
   Sea elves see the ocean as both friend and foe, it is its own being.
They appreciate two types of tides; the literal tide of high and low water,
but also the tide of fury, sometimes in, but thankfully, usually out.
<p>
<b>_The Military_</b>
<p>
   The race prides itself on its military tradition. Sea elves have long
been responsible for the majority of the elven military, perhaps because
they are quite often the victims of opening hostilities. The large battles
of the past are something not likely to be seen again as the sea elves have
declined in numbers since the Elf-Dwarf wars. A sea elf devotes five
decades of its life to service in the clan naval fleets, holding dual
positions of merchant and soldier.
<p>
   Most military actions now are against human ships prying near the elven
kingdoms, or against the dark elves of Naggaroth who occasionally attack
sea elven settlements.
<p>
<b>_Trade_</b>
<p>
   The merchant fleet of a clan will cross the seas trading all that is
available in the world, from fine wines to furniture and spice. Nowadays,
trading is the main function of the clans, most of their energies are
directed towards it and consequently their results are mostly very
rewarding. Sea elf clans are wealthy, the settlement in Marienburg, for
example, is very well to do. The highest standard of living is attained by
sea elves living with their clan, some humans liken them to princes. In
some ports the name has stuck and the rich elves are called merchant
princes.
<p>
<b>_The Free Spirit_</b>
<p>
   When a sea elf comes of age he or she leaves the clan for ten years to
travel. This leave does not allow for an absence should the koveniporio
occur during the time the elf is away, but apart from that, no other ties
to the clan remain. The purpose of the free spirit is to assuage the need
to travel independently in the young elf who might be entertaining the
idea. When they return they are usually more than happy to serve their
clan, being in a better position to appreciate the benefits of clan life.
Any who do not return from their travelling are exiled forever.
<p>
<b>_Sea Elven Outlook_</b>
<p>
   The sea elven outlook on life and other races is very similar to that of
other elves except for two fundamental differences; their view of humans
and dwarves. Dwarves are generally distrusted as by other elves, sea elves
however, are quicker to look for redeeming features. Essentially, they are
tolerant of dwarves, having forgiven the hostilities of the past. This is
no small thing as sea elves suffered greatly at dwarven hands during the
Elf-Dwarf wars. Humans also are not completely trusted but are viewed as
good trading partners and, as long as mutual benefit applies, as a
worthwhile ally.
<p>
   To other elves, these attitudes are evidence of a taint of something
primal. Humanity is slowly invigorating the sea elven culture, this energy
spreads like waves on an ocean, and these waves are crashing on the shores
of the elven kingdoms, spreading slow change through their society. These
repercussions are recognised by neither humans or elves. Only the dark
elves notice, they watch their kindred with growing hatred.
<p>
<ul>
 The dark messenger entered the last and largest hall. It was lit by a
single brazier, a fire-red glow stood out on the face of his master. A
bloodied knife was fingered in a powerful hand, deep eyes looked up.
<p>
   "I have been to Lothern, my Master."
   The lips of the Master curled, the knife dropping to the floor. The
sounds of the stone and metal echoed through the hall.
<p>
   "And what do our weakling kin do in their toy city?"
   "they have welcomed the returned musicians from the nations of man. The
taint of man is now heard in our songs and music, now it is the music of
man."
<p>
   "What fools they are, can they not see what man does to them? We will
one day save them from themselves. For that day we must ready ourselves."
</ul>
<p>
<b>_Religion_</b>
<p>
   The sea elves follow one god, he is Mathlann, the god of the seas.
Mathlann has two children called spirit friends. Sea elven initiates and
priests of Mathlann follow the same guidelines as those applicable to
Manann. Priests are called Messengers due to the unique nature of elvish
interaction with their gods. Like Mathlann, his children are friends of the
sea elves and not their masters. Instead of the elves worshipping them,
they deal with them through the Messengers. This is not to say elves do not
have faith in their deities. Elves trust them, but they do not have blind
faith in them. They can be used and abused with dire consequence and should
be treated with respect.
<p>
<b>_Rota-Himmel_</b>
<p>
   She is the spirit friend for the night, starts and navigation. Her name
means Glowing Sky, she points the way for sea elven ships and traders,
always showing the path home. She represents the skies and everything in
them such as the birds, stars, the moon (Mannslieb), and the clouds. The
stars are her most important attribute as elves rely upon them for
navigation - they do not use maps. Rota-Himmel is pictured as a young elven
woman with long black flowing hair. She is a spirit friend of knowledge.
<p>
<b>_Senparae_</b>
<p>
   He is the spirit friend for negotiation, dealing and trade. His name
means to communicate freely, he represents many things. Some humans
misunderstand him, thinking of him as a god of trade. This is in his sphere
but so too are conversation, relationships and land. Senparae is summarised
by what the sea elves actually do in ports. It may be their home, where
they trade, but most importantly it is where they live in community. It
would be more correct for humans to call him god of the clan, even perhaps
of life.
<p>
   Senparae is pictured as a merchant always standing on dry land but with
the sea on the horizon, he is never pictured alone. Messengers of Senparae
are more gregarious than normal sea elves and will habitually seek company
and conversation.

   Sea elves all have the skills of orientation and sailing. They have
equal chance of having either excellent vision, fish, row or boat building.
<p>
   Sea elves have the normal <b>d3-1 fate points</b> and use all other elf
information such as age, height and weight. For Careers reference the chart
given at the end of this article. Careers are slightly different, below are
some new careers which are only available to sea elves, or high and wood
elves living with a sea elf clan.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>_Diver_</b>
<p>
   Used for varying tasks, sea elf Divers are trained for endurance and to
carry out specialised work underwater; repairing the hull of a ship,
cleaning the hull of marine growths such as barnacles and diving for
valuable sea goods eg. pearls and abalone. Divers are well known for
holding their breath. They are also known to be powerful swimmers and
capable of fighting underwater when attacked by sea creatures. The best
Seaman will often go on the more dangerous career of Diver, with more
danger often comes a greater reward. A Diver fights with no modifiers when
engaged in combat in the water. The new skill of Diving is detailed below.

</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>_Vigilante_</b>
<p>
   A unique part of sea elf society is the emergence of vigilante groups.
They shadow the local militia (usually unknown to it) of the sea elven
quarter in coastal cities. To understand why these groups have evolved and
what exactly they are about, we must look firstly at the independent nature
of sea elven ghettos within human cities.
<p>
   Whether the quarter is a small section of the wharf side or perhaps
physically quite large part of the main city, it is legally independent
from the rest of the metropolis. When the sea elf clan first arrives at a
port and decides to make the place its home, it seeks the permission of the
local authorities to allow the clan to land and rule its own affairs. Human
authorities have to decide whether they are prepared to give away part of
their city. If so, are they then prepared to have a part of their city
where their guards are not allowed to enter. The benefits of having a clan
based in a port always tempt the local rulers, usually they give their
permission and the most run down part of the wharf is cleared of beggars
and thieves then handed to the elves.
<p>
   While the clan's militia keeps their quarter clean and safe they can do
nothing for the rest of the city where they have no jurisdiction. This is
the Vigilantes' role. They spread through the rest of the city after dark
seeking out one specific type of law breaker (in their eyes), that is,
chaos cultists among the human population. Most vigilantes will, once they
have tracked down their prey, lure them near or into the elven quarter.
Once the victim is in an elven controlled area it can be killed without
arousing the attention of the authorities. This behaviour is inspired by
the elves feeling of insecurity living amongst so many humans. Treachery
is a very real possibility, it is upon such thoughts that they act.
<p>
   Vigilante abilities make them deadly to their enemies, but sadly they
are small in number. Also, their actions do not go completely unnoticed and
it becomes increasingly harder to dig out the weeds from human society. An
average Vigilante group will have around four members. The group does not
travel randomly through the city but will have carefully researched their
possible targets. Eventually, if they discover that the person concerned is
illegal in their eyes, they will set out on a search and destroy mission.
Each separate investigation and execution will take up to eight weeks to
complete. A group of sea elf vigilantes may spend up to four nights a week
on a suspect, hiding what they are doing from the rest of the clan. The
clan, regardless of whether it approves of vigilantes or not, cannot
officially help them as it is deemed interference with the human city's
affairs. Such actions breech the original agreement made between the city
and the clan.
<p>
   The reaction from the local human authorities where these groups are
known to operate is usually one of feigned ignorance. Where Municipal
militia are under great pressure from the criminal and chaotic elements of
the Old World they often welcome the aid of sea elf vigilantes. Other
cities, however demand a stop, claiming the activity is both unlawful and
dangerous. Often it is in these cities that vigilantes are most needed.

<b>_Merchant Prince_</b>
<p>
   Merchant Princes are the master merchants aboard a sea elven trading
ship. They are distinguished from the normal run of sea elven Merchants by
their opulent finery, their consummate skill when dealing, and their grand
worldly manner.
<p>
   This exclusive career often marks the end of clan naval service by the
individual. It is the goal of the upwardly mobile of the sea elves, an
example of the human-like ambition of the race. Many choose to become
Explorers, revisiting some of the rare sights viewed during their naval
days, but at a more leisurely pace.
<p>
   Often a Merchant Prince becomes elected to the elevated position of Clan
Elder. To outsiders, all sea elves seem to have the cultured air and finery
of merchant princes.

<p>
<b>_Marienburg_</b>
<p>
   In many ocean ports a sea elf quarter will be expected, the sight of a
sea elf common. The sea elf quarters of ports are old, beautiful and noble
places. The population spread of sea elves amounts to groupings or clusters
where clans have settled or maintain trading posts. Their largest
communities are at Merrantalla in Lustria, Jer-Loren in Araby, Kao-Llermer
in Nippon and the coastal cities of Lustria. The largest concentration of
sea elves in the Old World can be found in Marienburg.
<p>
   The Marienburg clan is called clan Tia-Farell. At the heart of the sea
elven quarter is their clan-ship, which no living human has ever seen. The
ship is used for many things, it is the Elder's home, it is also a museum
of the clan's origins and the only truly elven artifact in Marienburg. It
is also the store house of sea elf knowledge and lore.
<p>
   The clan has its own section of the wharf, and a sizable slice of the
city. The elven quarter consists of three islands, the largest of which has
the clan ship at its centre in a small lake. The quarter's buildings are
ringed around the massive vessel to hide it from non-elven eyes. The entire
quarter is separated, either by the river or stone walls, from the rest of
the city. Access is exclusively through gates guarded by elven militia. The
largest island of the three is strictly off limits to all but elves due to
its holding the clan-ship.
<p>
<b>_Summary_</b>
<p>
   Sea elves are generally an open minded and fair race, they have their
arrogance, but that is part of being an elf. Their mixing with humans and
other races has proven their flexibility and good intentions. Essentially
they are the only race of elves who are prepared to look beyond what they
have and what they are. To a large extent the future of the elven race
rests heavily on their shoulders, fortunately they are prepared to bear the
burden.
<p>
<ul>
  As the cool of our kin of the sea fails,
so do their singing voices slowly hush
Their culture mixes with that of man,<br>
they live in his cities and are welcome.
<p>
   A great ship drifts from its moorings,
towards troubled waters of a whirlpool.
<p>
   It is the ship of the sea elves,<br>
heading towards the vortex of man.'
