I read the post on rolling Ogre PCs, and thought it was a nice
place to start, but would like to suggest a differant characteristic
roll-up scheme.  (I would reference the original post, but I
accidentally deleted it.)

<table border=5><tr>
<th>M</th><th>Ws</th><th>Bs</th><th>S</th><th>T</th><th>W</th><th>I</th></tr>
<td>D3+4</td><td>2D10+20</td><td>2D10+10</td><td>D3+3</td><td>D3+4</td><td>D3+15</td><td>2D10+20</td></tr>
<th>A</th><th>Dex</th><th>Ld</th><th>Int</th><th>Cl</th><th>Wp</th><th>Fel</th></tr>
<td>1</td><td>2D10+10</td><td>2D10+10</td><td>D6+13</td><td>2D10+10</td><td>2D10+20</td><td>2D10</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
For increasing characteristics, I would say, the first eight
scores are increased at normal experince cost, while the last
six scores cost 3 times the normal value to improve, other than
int, which improves at a rate of 1 per 100 exp pts spent.
