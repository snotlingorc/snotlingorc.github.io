<h2>A TREATISE ON DWARVEN CULTURE - by Psychedelic Goblin</h2>

<p>
The following notes are written to cover the culture of the Mountain
Dwarves of the Worlds Edge, Grey and Black Mountains. These dwarves
still follow dwarven culture in its purest form. After each section
is a note on how the culture of the Imperial Dwarves differs.
<hr>
<p>
<STRONG>RELATIONSHIPS AND MARRIAGE</STRONG><br>
Due to the low female to male ratio, relationships can prove a problem
in dwarven culture. The dwarven women have the opportunity to choose
a mate from a variety of candidates. The female has total power in
the selection process, and the males must compete for her affections.
The female chooses her candidates on the basis of desirable traits, such
as courage, intellect, wisdom, honesty, honour, reputation and skill,
but the final choice is based on stability, compatibility and how
responsible the mate will be as a parent. When the female has made
her decision, it is dishonourable for the male dwarf to refuse.
With the females having strong positions in dwarven society, they
have a desire to have strong mates to give their relationship
durability. Their relationships tend to be very cooperative, and are
purely monogamous until the death of a partner, when the female is
expected to take another mate. Dwarven relationships are not
tempestuous, intense or hot blooded, being more akin to strong
friendship and respect. This respect extends to privacy, both in
itself and regarding female form and functions. Male dwarves are
painfully shy and respectful of a females sexuality, and no male
dwarf would ever make crude or lewd remarks about a female of any
species. It is very dishonourable to do so.
With only 33% of male dwarves ever attaining a relationship, the rest
dedicate themselves to their work. No dwarf would ever use the
services of a prostitute or brothel, nor have sex with any female
other than a dwarf, and even then not before marriage.
To give in to primal urges is one of the greatest dishonours, with
rape being among the greatest.<br>
Dwarven marriages are private affairs, and performed
without pomp and ceremony.<br>
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - Due to being much less condensed than their
mountain counterparts, it can be a problem for a male dwarf to even
find a female. Also, because they are not under constant threat,
breeding is not quite so important. Due to these considerations
courting often takes place along human lines, and taking another mate
is not required. Nevertheless, the female still has the power, and
male dwarves are still subject to the same taboos and feelings.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>PREGNANCY AND BIRTH</STRONG><br>
Dwarven females are pregnant for 16 months and aren't really affected
by the it for the first 11 months. The mate will dote on the female
to a vast extent, and the prospect of a new dwarven child warms the
heart of even the toughest dwarf. Male dwarves have a very strong
paternal instinct which leads them to be surprisingly patient and
considerate with the young of any race. No male dwarf would even
raise a hand against a goblin child!<br>
To a male dwarf, hitting a child with force is an abuse of their
greater strength, and any physical punishment is in the form of
labour.<br>
At birthing times it is not unusual to find every male dwarf in the
community happily creating some miniature trinket (such as tiny axes,
hammers, tools etc) for the coming newborn.
The actual birth is restricted to the females of the community. Even
the mate is not allowed to be present (and due to their shyness about
such matters they are usually happy about their exclusion).
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - In the more relaxed Imperial life the males are
allowed to be present at the birthing (but still usually avoid it!).</i>

<p>
<STRONG>CHILD REARING</STRONG><br>
Dwarven children are encouraged to be responsible for their actions
from the start, and become independent at a very early age.
Dwarven parents are strict but fair, and do not protect their
children from the negative aspects of the real world. Dwarves know
life is hard, and so their children must be prepared for it.
All children, both male and female, are taught the basics of conflict
from an early age, and are discouraged from showing outward displays
of emotion. Both parents are responsible for raising and teaching the
child (esp. the child of their own sex, which usually means the male has
most of the parenting duties).<br>
It is considered a great tribute and honour for both concerned, if
the child follows in the footsteps of its parents.
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - Child rearing has not really changed for the
Imperial dwarves, but they can now send their children to centres of
learning such as universities.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>DEATH</STRONG><br>
Death is seen as a sad fact of life in dwarven society, and their
funeral rites are very solemn affairs. The funeral of a mate or
beloved friend is one of the few times crying is not frowned upon,
but getting too emotional (i.e. anything more than a few stray tears)
is considered disrespectful. The deceaseds tools and belongings are
passed out to the family and friends. Due to space considerations,
the body is usually cremated.<br>
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - The Imperials do not have the same space
restrictions that the mountain ones do, and so have in many cases
revived the older tradition of burial.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>RULERSHIP</STRONG><br>
Dwarven rulership is hereditary, with each dwarven stronghold having
its own noble line. Rulership is a heavy burden in dwarven culture,
and great things are expected of those in such positions of power.
The dwarven rulers have absolute power in their community, but rarely
excercise it without first consulting their advisors. All rulers have
a council of advisors (mostly female) and the rulers edicts are also
administered and organised by the women.
Rulers are expected to exemplify all that dwarves regard as good and
true (honour, courage, wisdom, strength etc) and those that fall
short of expectations find many of their edicts ignored. Those found
severely lacking are forced to abdicate until a better successor can
be found. During such indredibly rare periods the council takes over.
Dwarves are tremendously loyal to the rulers they respect, and it is
a tribute to dwarven integrity that very few of their rulers have
been anything other than paragons of dwarven virtue.
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - As full Imperial citizens the Imperial dwarves no
longer have a dwarven nobility, but instead swear fealty to the
Empire and Emporer. There are few Imperial Dwarven nobles, and female
administration is no longer the norm.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>CRIME AND JUSTICE</STRONG><br>
As would be expected, dwarven justice is harsh indeed. All crimes are
judged by female magistrates and assessed acording to 4 penalties:
<ul>
<li>Heinous (i.e. rape, cowardice or neglect that results in the death
of a fellow dwarf)): Burnt alive, or sent out heavily bound and naked
near a goblinoid camp (with their tongue cut out so they cant talk).
<li>Major (i.e. continued cowardice or theft): Summary execution.
<li>Typical (i.e. an act of cowardice or making an unseemly comment
about a female): Public ridicule and severe lashing and labour for a
period set by the wronged party.<br>
<li>Minor (i.e. refusing a female dwarf who has chose you as a suitor):
public ridicule.<br>
</ul>
<p>
It is also worth noting that many dwarves do not reach trial, because
the community often lynches them first. For lesser dishonours, or
unpunished greater ones, the dwarf (if they have any honour left)
usually undertakes the life of a slayer.
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - They are governed by Imperial law but are still
governed by traditional honour concepts. Dwarves are still likely to
lynch wrongdoers, or in the case of personal dishonour, become a
slayer.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>RELIGION</STRONG><br>
Religion in the dwarven community is strong and ritualised, but
ultimately private. In addition to their gods, ancestor worship is
very strong for them. All dwarves who die honourable are said to go
to the Hall of Warriors (a parralel to the Norse Valhalla) where they
reside with the gods. Favoured gods include Grungni, Rukh, Hrungnor
and Morngrim. The ancestors are too numerous to mention.
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - There has been no real change in this area, but
some dwarves have adopted the worship of Sigmar.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>MAGIC</STRONG><br>
All dwarves have a very strong inherent resistence to magic, and this
makes it difficult for them to follow the spell caster careers.
However, they are no strangers to magic and have turned to the
creation of magical artefacts as their main source of magical power.
They are the best Runesmiths in existence, and the vast majority of
the greatest magical items (including those used by elves and humans)
are dwarven made.<br>
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - With the proximity to humans it is easier for a
dwarf to find a teacher of the arcane arts,but the main practitioners
of dwarven magic crafts such as runesmithing are still in the
mountains.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>DEFENSE AND WAR</STRONG><br>
The Worlds Edge dwarves are in a state of near constant conflict, and
must maintain complete battle readiness at all times. The dwarven
military is experienced, organised and very effective (perhaps even
the best in the world). Units of Tunnel Fighters deal with attacks
and subterranean clearances, and soldiers deal with surface attacks.
All dwarven military act as guards and watchmen, and are drilled
constantly. They also maintain heavy weapons such as trebuchet,
catapults and bolt throwers at every tower and wall. They are
intelligent combatants and will retreat if a situation is to bad.
They are primarily defensive fighters (due to low numbers) and only
launch attacks to free/reclaim fallen holds or slay chaos dwarves
(who they see as a stain on the collective honour of the dwarven
race).<br>
Due to childhood training, all dwarves are at least familiar with
weapons, but it is taboo for the rare dwarven females to join the
military.<br>
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - They still follow the childhood training
traditions but face a much lower combat expectancy. Obviously, they
now fight for the Empire. There are no Imperial born Tunnel
Fighters except in Middenheim, and no Imperial born Runners.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>FOOD AND DIET</STRONG><br>
Due to the inhospitable mountain climate, and large underground
complexes, the dwarven diet is fairly restricted. They keep
enclosures of mountain goats and sheep, grow a wide variety of
mushrooms and some tubers. Water is taken from underground springs,
as are a few subterranean fish. The only alcohol they produce is a
form of vodkha (tuber wine) and a pungent mushroom ale called Akorak.
Their only bread is a flat, unlevened variety made from tuber flour.
<p>
<i>Imperial Dwarves - Imperial dwarves have access to the full range of
food that any Imperial citizen has.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>THE DRINKING MYTH</STRONG><br>
Due to their constant need for battle readiness, the mountian dwarves
cannot afford to get drunk, and so rarely have more than 1 or 2
drinks. They do enjoy alcohol, but they cannot afford the luxury of
drinking to much. Also, getting drunk is risky, because it encourages
lack of control that could lead to dishonourable behaviour.
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - Imperials have a more relaxed attitude to
drinking than those of the mountains, but still frown upon getting
drunk. It is the actions of the dishonourable few that has coloured
the stereotype of the drunken dwarf.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>ARTS</STRONG><br>
Dwarven arts are very straightforward and restrictive. Performance
wise, they favour drums, horns and rich songs and tales, but most of
their art revolves around the embellishment of items. No dwarf would
create a work of art for its own sake. All dwarven art pieces must
have some use and vice versa.<br>
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - With contact with humans, the dwarven mind has
expanded to the arts, and art for its own sake.</i>

<p>
<STRONG>CRAFTS</STRONG><br>
Dwarven craftsmanship is among the best there is and forms a very
important part of their culture. The crafts are part of each dwarfs
family and history and they are passed down through the generations.
To a dwarf, they are a source of honour, pride and self reliance.
<p>
<i>Imperial dwarves - No real change.</i>
