<h3>A TREATISE ON HALFLINGS v.3 </h3>
- by Psychedelic Goblin
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<STRONG>THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY</STRONG><br>
'Halflings more than any other race see themselves as members of a
society rather than as individuals' - Apocrypha Now
Halflings are a very rural folk, and the mainstay of their culture is
agriculture and livestock. The majority of their dwellings resemble
nothing more than downsized human cottages, but those living in close
proximity to a hill live in a very unique dwelling called a Burrow.
A burrow is essentially a home cut into the hillside, and can range
in size from a single room to a veritable mansion. One thing they all
have in common are south facing doors and windows. This keeps the
burrow warmer by facing away from the cold north wind.
There are very few purely halfling dwellings, and any halfling
village with a population in excess of 100 will consist of about 10%
humans. The only exception to this is the Moot.

<p>
<STRONG>RELATIONSHIPS AND MARRIAGE</STRONG><br>
As noted in Apocrypha Now, halflings are a sexually puritan race who
see promiscuous behaviour as abhorrent. The strongest unit in any
halflings heart is their family, and halflings make the most devoted
and loving parents and partners of any race. The majority of them
tend to marry their childhood sweethearts.

<p>
<STRONG>PREGNANCY AND BIRTH</STRONG><br>
A halfling female is pregnant for 9 months and is doted on by
everyone around her. The birth is usually assisted by a midwife of
Esmerelda or Rhya, and is as varied as any human birth. Friends and
relatives gather to celebrate with a party and shower the mother with
birthing gifts.

<p>
<STRONG>CHILD REARING</STRONG><br>
The raising of children is a very family orientated affair, with the
end result that the halfling child has a wider world view, broader
mind, and a vast plethora of favourite 'uncles' and 'aunties'.
The children spend most of their time running around playing,
climbing trees and getting in the way. Halflings are very patient
with their young, with smacking being taboo in their culture. A
halfling parent must take the time to explain to the child when there
is a problem, and fortunately halfling children are no where near as
stubborn or selfish as human ones.

<p>
<STRONG>DEATH</STRONG><br>
Halfling view death as part of the natural life cycle, but this
doesn't prevent their funeral rites from being sorrowful affairs.
Halflings form close personal bonds, and the severing that death
causes can have a profound impact. At the funeral the community
gathers to tell of fond memories, and the deceaseds belongings are
given out in accordance with her will. It is worth noting here that
all halflings make out a will as soon as they are able. They are
nothing if not prepared. After the rite, the body is taken out a
little way into the wilds and buried.

<p>
<STRONG>RULERSHIP</STRONG><br>
All halfling governship occurs by mass meeting, or as they call it 'a
Moot'. The head of each village is the Elder, but this doesn't
necessarily imply great age. The elder is usually the most popular,
intelligent and wise halfling. The community as a whole votes for
their elder, and only vote again if they perceive a problem. All of
the elders meet in a grand moot to sort out matters on a larger
scale, and when necessary elect a chair-halfling. The chair-halfling
is invested with an Imperial vote to chose a new Emporer.
There are noble halflings in the realm of man but the typical
halfling views them as 'big sillies' and treats them no differently.
To their credit, halfling nobles are the most downhome, relaxed, and
considerate nobles you could wish to meet. Very few wish to be
treated any different, or put on airs and graces.

<p>
<STRONG>CRIME AND JUSTICE</STRONG><br>
Halflings are very lenient in their attitude towards minor crimes
providing the act doesn't cause hardship or harm. Real or violent
crime is rare in their communities and surprisingly few rural
halflings follow Rogue careers. There is no Thieves Guild in halfling
lands. Punishments range from reduced food (sob!) to exile for
serious or constantly repetitive crimes (even halfling patience can
run out eventually). All cases are judged by the elder and enforced
by the militia. No criminal is ever judged on merit of birth or
wealth. Execution is unheard of. In those cases that warrant such
dire action the offender is handed over to human magistrates...
Halfling outlaws are rare, and are usually those who would be viewed
in the modern world as insane.

<p>
<STRONG>RELIGION</STRONG><br>
Halflings have a very relaxed and tolerant attitude to religion. Even
their clerics are unusually tolerant of other faiths. Few halflings
restrict themselves to 1 deity, and instead pay lip service to many
as they need to. The largest cult by far is that of Esmerelda and her
family: Merrill, Gangee, Findol, Landrani, Praseeda, and Samortha.
Rhya is worshipped to a lesser extent.<br>
Ranald is only really worshipped by those halflings who dwell in human cities.
There is only one intolerant branch of halfling religion: The Ratspike.
&gt;Note - Any follower of Esmerelda or Merrill can also worship any
number of the other 'Family Pantheon' relatives.

<p>
<STRONG>MAGIC</STRONG><br>
Halflings are very magic resistant and this makes it difficult for
them to master the arcane arts. They are however, still fascinated by
it, and any known spellcaster visiting a halfling community will be
pestered by excitable halfling children into putting on a show.
Halfling magic users are very dedicated ( they have to be to
overcome their handicap in this area), but are also very unassuming,
and usually ignore the typical wizardly trappings.

<p>
<STRONG>DEFENSE AND WAR</STRONG><br>
There are very few halfling warriors, and those that follow the path
tend to prefer ranged conflict, a sensible decision considering their
physical disadvantages. Many races view halflings as cowardly but
this is blatantly untrue. It is usual that a foe underestimates these
determined little folk and doesn't live to regret it...
The vast majority of the halfling warriors are members of the
militia, and they fight very cohesively in times of trouble. They are
usually led by a cleric of Merrill.

<p>
<STRONG>FARMING AND HERDING</STRONG><br>
Although halfling are sometimes viewed as lazy by ignorant outsiders,
they are really determined and tenacious workers. As their
communities run on agriculture and herding they necessitate hard and
constant work. A halfling will quite happily toil from dawn to dusk
with only a few short lunch breaks and return home smiling. Hardwork
builds up an appetite and ensures better sleep. An old halfling
proverb perhaps sums up their attitude best:
'No food tastes as good as that you raised or grew yourself'.

<p>
<STRONG>FOOD AND DIET</STRONG><br>
They are the best cooks in existence, and they all learn to cook as
children. Think of the best food possible and it's probably nothing
compared to what a halfling can create. 'nuff said.
Taste is more important than quantity.

<p>
<STRONG>ARTS AND CRAFTS</STRONG><br>
While halfling arts and crafts are not as renowned as those of
dwarves, elves or gnomes, they are still excellant. Their nimble
fingers enable them to create detail no dwarf, gnome or human can
rival. They are without a doubt the best weavers, tailors and leather
workers of any of these races.

<p>
<STRONG>FESTIVALS</STRONG><br>
Halfings love parties, and conduct them at the drop of a hat, and for
nearly any reason. Parties are always held in the Party Field from
noon to the following dawn and in addition to featuring vast
quantities of food and storytelling, also feature many games.
Slinging, wrestling, country dancing and fiddle playing are all
favourites in mild weather, and skiing, ice skating and sleding are
popular in winter. All Party Fields feature wide shallow ponds, and
even if one doesn't naturally exist, they create one by irrigation. Parties
are held on both equinoxes, the summer solstice, the last day of
harvest, every birthday, the founding of the village and especially
Pie Week.

<p>
<b>MERRILL the Defender</b><br>
<p>
Merrill is the halfling deity associated with the defense of the home
and community. He is not an aggressive or warlike deity, and is in
fact warm and friendly. He would rather avoid conflict, and never
wages war. However, he is resolute in the defense of the halfling
community. He is the loving and devoted husband of Esmerelda, and
caring and good natured father of Gangee and Findol. He most often
appears as a stout, muscular halfling with a thick mop of curly
golden hair and large sideburns. He has a determined face, but
his eyes twinkle with happiness. He bears a shield, sling staff, and
shortsword, and wears well made leather.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral<br>
<li><b>Symbol:</b> A circle under a triangle, representing the shield in front
of the home.<br>
<li><b>Area of Worship:</b> All halfling rural communities
<li><b>Temples:</b> No real temples but many halfling villages have a shrine to
him.<br>
<li><b>Friends/Enemies:</b> He is friendly to his family and any outsider who

(in that order).
</ul>
<li><b>Spells:</b> All Petty, Battle, and Elementalist lvl 1 and 2.<br>
<li><b>Skills:</b> Clerics and Initiates of Merrill may purchase one of these
skills at each level for the usual cost of 100xp.

</ul>

<p>
<b>GANGEE the Protector of the Pantry</b><br>
(based on a concept by Alfred Nunez)<br>
<P>
Gangee is the halfling deity of Ratcatchers. He is the son of
Esmerelda and Merrill and younger brother of Findol. With the
importance of food to the halfling community he is charged with
defending these stocks from vermin. He is boisterous and childlike
(not childish) but never shirks his duties. He appears as a slim
halfling with very short blonde hair, bearing a razor sharp dagger
called Ratspike and a sling.<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral<br>
<li><b>Symbol:</b> A ratshead with crossed eyes and a dagger through it.
<li><b>Area of Worship:</b> anywhere halflings have pantries or work as
ratcatchers<br>
<li><b>Temples:</b> A small sigil is located in all halfling pantries
<li><b>Friends/Enemies:</b> He is friendly to his family and neutral to most
outsiders. He bears unremitting hatred for the Horned Rat and Skaven.<br>
<li><b>Holy Days:</b> Pie Week<br>
<li><b>Notes:</b> There is no real cult to Gangee and thus no clerics. The
closest he has to a religious body are the Protectors of the Pantry
and the Ratspike. He will occasionally bless members of the Ratspike,
but the degree of this is up to the GM.
</ul>
<ol>
<p>
<li><b>Protectors of the Pantry</b><br>
created and copyright to Alfred Nunez<br>
<p>
The Protectors of the Pantry are halflings who follow the cults of
Esmerelda and her son Gangee (Protector of the Pantry). The sacred
task of protecting the Halfling pantries from the predations of
vermin, especially rats, have fallen to them. The Protectors of the
Pantry are adept at hunting down and killing vermin and do so with
(for a halfling) fanatical zeal. In other respects, Protectors of the
Pantry are normal Halflings and are far more sociable and cleaner
than their Human Ratcatcher counterparts.<br>
 For career advance scheme, career exits, and trappings see the
Ratcatcher basic career, WFRP, pg.36. Moreover, Protectors of the
Pantry are subject to Hatred versus rats and rat-like creatures
(including Skaven).
<p>
<b>The Ratspike (created by me)</b><br>
The Ratspike are a small and secretive group of Gangee devotees who
have but one mission: the eradication of the skaven and the ruination
of their plans. Even the halfling community remains largely unaware
of their membership. They organise covert meetings when necessary,
and many travel and adventure (in the guise of a common ratcatcher)
throughout the Empire and Tilea (due to the presence of
Skavenblight). They acquire as much information as possible on their
elusive foe, and when possible organise covert commando raids on
skaven outposts. Their travels have built up an extensive web of
contacts (including the Cake Fellowship) and they have perhaps the
greatest knowledge of the skaven threat.

<p>
<li>Ratspike Infiltrator (Halfling Only)<br>
<p>
The Ratspike infiltrators are the recon branch of the group
and responsible for information gathering and reports. They are to
avoid confrontation, detection and capture at all costs, and will
commit suicide rather than allow them. They operate alone or in pairs
and are often accompanied by several highly trained tracking dogs.
Upon completion of their mission they return to their base of
operations and organise a commando assault to which they provide
ballistic support.<br>

<P>
The Ratspike commandoes are experienced members who are responsible

warriors but they are not foolish. They will retreat if the situation
gets too desperate. They usually enter conflict iwht several trained
warhounds.<br>

<p>
* Charcoal Mask<br>
This is a face mask of hardened leather or metal, vented, with a damp
cloth and charcoal layer inside. It provides armour to the head
(leather or metal) and acts as a primitive gas mask (+20% to resist
gas attacks). It resembles a hockey mask.

<p>
**Verminwrack<br>
This is a powerful concentrate of common rat poison and is lethal to
all vermin including skaven and their creations. It is thick and
sticky and thus makes excellant blade venom. Its creation is a
closely guarded Ratspike secret.<br>
1 dose: Paralysed<br>
2+ doses: Death<br>
It acts as a deleriant to other races and creatures.<br>
It requires 3 doses of rat poison to make 1 dose of verminwrack.
</ol>

<p>
<b>FINDOL the Warden of the Fields</b><br>
(based on a concept by Alfred Nunez)<br>
<p>
Findol is the older brother of Gangee and son of Esmerelda and
Merrill. Like his father and brother he is also a protector. He is
charged to watch over the halfling agricultural fields and livestock
and keep them free from depredation ranging from vermin to raiding
goblinoids. Findol is friendly but much more restrained than Gangee.
He appears as a tall, tanned halfling with long curly locks, wearing
leather, and bearing a stave/crook, shrotbow and sling.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Alignment:</b> Neutral<br> 
<li><b>Symbol:</b> a crook and sickle<br>
<li><b>Area of Worship:</b> all rural halfling communities<br>
<li><b>Temples:</b> all fields are his temples<br>
<li><b>Friends/Enemies:</b> see Merrill. Has friendly relations with Taal, Rhya,
and the Old Faith<br>
<li><b>Holy Days:</b> Pie Week and every harvest<br>
<li><b>Notes:</b> Findol has no real cult or clerics. He does have a faction
that follows his example: The Wardens of the Field
</ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>The Wardens of the Field</b><br>
(created and copyright to Alfred Nunez)
The Wardens of the Field are Halflings who follow the cults of
Esmerelda and her son Findol (Warden of the Fields). Similar to the
Protectors of the Pantry, the wardens have a sacred task: the
protection of the agricultural fields of halflings from vermin
ranging from ravenous insects to marauding bands of  Goblins and
Snotlings (anything bigger often requires the hiring of Humans or
dwarves). Wardens of the Field are excellant woodsmen and scouts.
During times of community danger, small groups of Wardens join
together to form a formidable force of bowmen and slingers.

<p>
<b>LANDRANI Mistress of Wine &amp; Beer</b><br>
based on a concept by Alfred Nunez<br>
<p>
Landrani is one of Esmereldas three daughters, and like her brothers;
Gangee and Findol, she doesn't have her own clerical cult.
She is immensely proud of the vast plethora of alcoholic beverages
she has created for the halfling race, and is always busy in the
cellar, creating (and testing quite extensively) her latest brew.
She is always happy and slightly tipsy from the alcohol and watches
Gangees rat killing with amusement. Praseeda has worked with her on
occassion, to create the spiced wines halflings are so fond of.
She appears as a slightly plump, female halfling, with a vast grin,
short blonde hair, a tankard and bottle of wine.
Her symbol is a tankard or bottle.<br>
While she has no 'true' cult, she does have a group of followers
called the 'Tasters of Landrani', who consider it their 'sacred' task
to sample (and consume) as many alcoholic drinks as possible.
All have the Consume Alcohol skill.
<p>
<b>PRASEEDA Lady of Herbs &amp; Spices</b><br>
based on a concept by Alfred Nunez<br>
<p>
Praseeda is another daughter of Esmerelda and Merrill, but is closer
to Findol, than any of her other siblings. She is the most rugged of
her sisters, and will spend hours outside looking for rare herbs.
Even so, she does potter around in the kitchen with her mother
(Esmerelda) and Samortha from time to time, and helps them spice up
the plainest of meals, or tend Gangee when he accidently cuts
himself with Ratspike. She also helps the family relax by providing
them with adequate quantities of pipeweed.
She is quiet, reserved and friendly. She appears as a slender female
halfling, with long, toussled, blonde hair, a green hood, and
slingbag.<br>
Her symbol is the green hood.<br>
While she has no cult as such, all halfling herbalists, and some
cooks pay her homage.<br>
She does have an order of dedicated herbalists called 'The Verdant
Cowl' who travel the Moot, healing, helping cooks and distributing
pipeweed. Treat as Herbalist but add trappings - green hood.

<p>
<b>SAMORTHA Guardian of Children, Families &amp; Desserts</b><br>
based on a concept by Alfred Nunez<br>
<p>
Have you ever wondered how halfling children can fall out of trees
and walk away with only a scraped knee? or why halfling relationships
are nearly trouble free?. Samortha is the answer.
Samortha is the final daughter of Esmerelda and Merrill, and is the
most 'homey' of her siblings. She helps soothe any arguments and
looks after the halfing children while they play. The rest of the
time she works in the kitchen with Esmerelda cooking up the sweet treats that
children (and adults) are so fond of. She is always chasing young Gangee
around to take away Ratspike so he doesn't hurt himself.
She appears as a very plump female halfling, with mid-length curly
blonde hair, and a concerned expression. She is always carrying a
spoon and lollipop. Her symbol is the lollipop. While she has no true
cult, all halflings love her dearly (esp. children).

<p>
<STRONG>DETAILS FOR ESMERALDA</STRONG><br>
by Alfred Nunez

<p>
Where Worshipped:  Esmeralda is worshipped by Halflings hroughout
the Old World.  She is particularly venerated by those Halflings
who are employed by Humans as cooks.  Unlike other cults, members
(including priests) of the cult of Esmeralda may include the
worship of any number of her children.  These are Gangee
(protector of the pantry), Findol (warden of the fields),
Landrani (mistress of wine and beer), Praseeda (lady of herbs and
spices), and Samortha (guardian of children, families, and
desserts).

<p>
Sub-Cults and Honorary Orders:  In addition to the worship of
Esmeralda, cultists may worship any number of her five children:
Gangee, Findol, Landrani, Praseeda, and Samortha.  Every detail
that applies to the cult of Esmeralda apply to these subcults
with few exceptions.

<p>
   This spell grants the invoking cleric the ability to
neutralize any poison, toxins, and deleriants added to any food
and drink within the area of effect.  Additionally, this spell
reverses any spoilage and resulting (natural) toxins from the
effected food and drink.  So healthy does the food and drink
become that anyone wounded will recover D3 wounds simply by
consuming such food and drink.  Should the consumer be suffering
from the effects of disease, poison, etc., they will be able to
take another Toughness test with a +30 modifier to overcome their
affliction.
<p>
   Note: the benefits of the spell occur immediately upon
consumption of the food and drink.  Any failed test cannot be
retaken until another spell is invoked.
