<h3>Mean Green and Ugly - <br>
the improved ORC for WFRP</h3>
<p>
        adapted by Hal 'ECHO' Eccles

<hr>
Since GW vamped Orcs up for Warhammer I thought I'd share with you what I have
done to bring the WFRP Orcs back into the fold.
<p>
 Savage Orcs
<hr>
Tribal orcs who are even more neolithic than their more common cousins.

Special Rules:
<ol>
  <li><b>Tribal Tattoos</b> - all savage Orcs are adorned with tattoos, a their tribal
custom dictates. All savage Orcs who do not wear body armour are protected by
their faith that the tattoos are actually magical they provide 0/1 armour on
all locations. (How about GO FASTA RED tattoos which give M+1 because the orcs
think they will be able to run faster :-) )

  <li><b>Frenzied Attack</b> - savage Orcs are very, primitivley mad, Whooping and
Screaming as they enter combat. Therefore they are subject to Frenzy as
described on Page 68 of the WFRP rulebook.
