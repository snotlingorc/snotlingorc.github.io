The Chaos Assassins (Assins) are greater Daemons, created by Khorne for the
sole purpose of hunting down and killing his mortal enemies. Each assin is
formed with a single, specific target. When the target is no more, by the
daemon's hand or otherwise, the Assin fades into nothingness and effectivly
dies. It is unknow how the Assins are created, though it seems likely that they
were once Chaos Spawn.
<p>
        An Assin's True Form is that of a dark, shadow-like humanoid,
man-sized, with two extra mouths instead of eyes. However, it is only the
unfortunate who ever see this. To pass through civilized areas un-noticed, teh
Assins possess any creature with an Int over 13. It actually 'Melds' with it's
host, having partial access to it's memories and skills. See below for details.

<p>
<b>Special Rules:</b>
<p>
                Melding/merging - Daemon7s profile and that of it's host are
averaged, rounding up, except for INT which stays at daemons, and W and I,
which become the Host's. May attempt to Murge with any living creature with INT
14+, however, if it's INT is over 24, it gets to make a WP test. If
successfull, then the Daemon cannot possess the intended Victim. (It tends to
just kill it, instead...). Clerics can NEVER be possessed, and anybody with at
least 2 spells makes their WP test at 2xWP.

<p>
                Splitting - Assins most vulnerable time. Host's body bubbles
and melts away, with an amonia-like smell, leaving the Assin in True Form. This
process lasts D3+1 rounds, during which time the Assin is prone, and can be
damaged with normal Weapons.

<p>
                In host, daemon can be wounded by normal weapons. If the host
has under 3 wounds, the Assin is forced to split with it. In it's true form, it
regains however many wounds it had when it first possessed the Host.

<p>
                Assins can sing their 'Song of Sleep' once per day. All
creatures with int 14+, including undead and daemons, must make WP tests, or
fall asleep for D3 Turns (Minutes). Victims are unable to be woken by
normal means.
<p>
                Wall Walk - Assins can climb and walk on walls and ceilings as
if unaffected by Gravity.
<p>
                Sighting - can see other Assins who are travelling in Hosts for
what they really are.
<p>
                Weaponry - can use ANY weapon, including Specialist weapons and
bare hands, without any penalty. Double all ranges for missile weapons.
<p>
                Song of Sleep is used to render Targets unconcious. The Assin
then embracess them, tenderly, and slowly presses it's face (In True Form) to
it's target's face. Carefully, almost lovingly, it will simultaniously bite out
the target's tongue and suck out it's eyes, with the Assin's 3 mouths. Venom
drips into the eye sockets and kills the target. Assin leaves no blood. The
Target feels no pain. The Assin then steps away from it's now deceased target,
and fades to nothingness, dying.
<p>
                Assins will kill all who get in their way, with whatever
weapons are to kand, but will ONLY kill it's target as described. If this is
not possible, Assiin will leave and return at another time. They are infinately
patient.

<p>
GOING ROGUE - Not all assins seem to be perfectly created. Whilst most do not
have personalities or any desires beyond slaying their target, a small handfull
(About 3%) have developed a will to live. (Exist ?)Instead of killing their
target, they murge with them - this can ONLY be done if the Target is willing.
In these rare cases a new, 3rd personality is created - a true melding of the
Assin and it's host.
<p>
        The profile is that of the Target, but it slowly changes to that of the
Assin (+10/+1 to 2 charas per month, at random (Or, in the case of a PC, at the
cost of 100 EPs...)). This entity has Wall-walk, sighting and weaponry
abilities, but the Song of Sleep is only available once at least 5 of the
characteristics are those of the Assin.
<p>
        The Assin is now forever imprisioned in this body. Once IT dies, the
Assin dies.<br>
Rogues are Hated by other assins, who will kill them on sight. Indeed, many are
created with a rogue as their target.

<p>
ASSINS are not subject to instability whilst in a host.
