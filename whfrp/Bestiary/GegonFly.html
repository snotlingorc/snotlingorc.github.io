<h3>
          The Gegon Fly<br>
</h3>

Found in the marshes around Miragliano, as well other bogs
and swamps around the Old World, the gegon fly is a large,
deep blue fly. It has an annoying bite, is usually harmless.
However, during Summer, the fly swells up with parasitic
eggs which it will attempt to lay in any living or dead
creature it comes across. The eggs have a 2 week gestation
period, during which the flesh around them will swell to a
scabby growth about half a centimetre in diameter. After two
weeks, a young fly will emerge from the wound.
The eggs are usually only mildly irritating, and can be cut
or burnt off. However, the gegon fly preferrs damp places to
lay its eggs. This can lead to eggs being laid around the
eyeball or in the *ahem* private places. As should be
expected, sores in these areas can get very irritating. It
is not unknown for men to go mad from the constant
irritation when they have a gegon fly bite on the eye lid.

          Too stupid to be affected by psychology.

<p>
Special Rules<br>
<pre>
          Sores have a 10% chance of becoming infected.
          Sores in delicate places result in a -5 to WS, BS, Cl and WP
          due to the constant irritation.
