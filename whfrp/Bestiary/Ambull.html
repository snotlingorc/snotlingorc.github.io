The Ambull is a large, barrel-chested creature which adopts an apelike 
stance.  Both arms and legs end in iron-hard claws used for
tunnelling through stone.  It is an alien, from the distant, hot Death
World of Luther MacIntyre IX.  It spends most of its time underground,
sheltering from the direct heat of the sun.  It is a carnivore,
usually preying on subterranean creatures.  In its own habitat, it
lives in family groups, constructing vast tunnel systems of remarkable
complexity.

<p>
The Ambull attacks with 2 claws and 1 bite.  By virtue of its size, it
can divide these attacks between two human-size opponents if it
wishes, attacking with one claw agains one target and using 2 attacks
against the other target.

<p>
<b>Psychology:</b> The Ambull causes fear in living creatures under 8 feet
tall.  A special point is that, because of its stupidity, the Ambull
is effectively immune to illusions.

<p>
The Ambull has three chief characteristics.  First, it is big and
vicious.  In a confined area, it is a deadly enemy indeed, capable of
inflicting lethal damage very quickly.  The PCs must try to lure it
into an area where several people can get around the creature and
attack it, or to get into a position where they can use missile fire
and ranged spells while the Ambull cannot get at them.  This can only
be done with very narrow passages where the Ambull cannot
[immediately] follow, but where a line of sight can be established.

<p>
The second major characteristic is the stupidity of the beast.  It is
obvious to you that following prey towards a narrow passage where you
cannot follow, but down which they can launch missile attacks, is
dumb.  It is obvious to you but not to an Ambull.  When you run an
Ambull, you play to get at the humans and eat them, although you don't
stop to eat while any are still attacking you.

<p>
The third major characteristic is the ability of the Ambull to tunnel
through rock.  So powerful are its claws and jaws that it can move
through solid rock with an effective movement rate of M2.  This allows
it to by-pass obstacles and take the most direct route to its prey.
