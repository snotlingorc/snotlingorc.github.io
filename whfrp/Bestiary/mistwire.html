Subject: [wfrp] new beastie for your consideration<br>
<hr>
Here is a monster for your consideration. It has proved itself to be a
wonderful menace for many groups of players. It is especially useful in
ruins and caves where the players have a hard time retreating from them
and a good chance of awakening them.

Mistwires are of unknown origin. They congregate in areas of high magic
(ie nodes, leylines, temple ruins, or wherever a GM thinks they belong).
They feed on the ambient magic of these places,draining small amounts of
energy. They are able to go dormant for long periods of time (100's of
years) when the "magic" of the area is depleted or removed. Any casting
of spells, active spell, or actively used magic item within a 10 yard
radius causes them to immediately wake and attack.
<p>
<b>PHYSIQUE:</b> Mistwires lair in cracks and crevices of stone or in small
diameter holes in the ground. They are found in clusters of 3d6. They
appear as translucent 1/4" thick glowing wires which can extend
themselves to 10yds. Colors vary according to the type of magic in the
area that they got from their last "meal". When no target is within
range, they wave back and forth extended 5 to 10 feet from their hole as
if swaying with an unknown current unless in hibernation (then they are
fully withdrawn).
<p>
<b>ALIGNMENT:</b> neutral
<p>
<b>PSYCH TRAIT:</b> none
<p>
<b>SPECIAL/COMBAT:</b> Mistwires always have their first attck with surprise if
hibernating.
<ul> They attack by whipping out in a 10yd radius from their anchor point,
attaching their tip to the target and wrapping themselves around causing
one S1/rnd. If they are hit by or touch a magic item/spell/magic weapon
they roll vs WP to drain as follows:
<dd><li>spell-d6magic pts(reduce spell effects accordingly)
<dd><li>item/weapon--neutralize item for d6rnds;if a 6 is rolled 30% chance 
    item permanently drained.
<p>
A mistwire wrapped around a magic using character (mage,priest,etc) will
drain d6MP per round automatically. They can be hit by normal weapons
and any number of mistwires can atttack a single creature with
cumulative effects!!
</ul>
