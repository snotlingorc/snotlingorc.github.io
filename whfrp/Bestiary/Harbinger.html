<h2>Harbingers</h2>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
        These are the messengers of the Gods. They are the spirit
form of that particular gods' minor demons, and one is assigned to
each Cleric, to ensure that he/she doesn't step out of line, and to
generally keep in touch with each of the deities representitives on
the world. It is through harbingers that the clerics learn their spells,
and gain spell points on a day to day basis.
<p>
        At a particular time every day, usually at dawn or midnight
( depending upon the particular deity, it may be at any time ), the
clerics Harbinger visits him/her. Depending on the behavior of the
cleric during the past day, the harbinger bestows the clerics Magic
Points for that day. In normal circumstances the cleric is allowed
his/her normal allowance ( as rolled ), however if the cleric has
been a little wayward, then some Magic Points may be withheld as
a form of punishment.
<p>
        In exceptional circumstances, when the cleric has done some
great deed in the eyes of his/her harbinger, whether greatly benificial
to, or greatly against the deities doctrine, the harbinger may be
accompanied by a more senior member of the pantheon ( usually a major
demon ). It is this demon who rewards the cleric or mets out the
punishment that he/she deserves.
<p>
        When asking for spells ( spending Experience Points ), the
clerics harbinger appears, to grant them, or deny them, according to
its instructions. However harbingers may only grant Petty Magic and
First Level spells. For higher levels, the harbinger must again be
accompanied by a major demonso that the major demon may bestow the
spell. This reliance on major demons for higher level spells means
that occationally a cleric, upon reaching Fourth Rank, has his/her
harbinger replaced by a major demon.
<p>
        At the appropriate level, all clerics gain the ability
to cast a "Summon Demon" spell. However only the clerics harbinger
will appear, and will ( usually ) be friendly, with no need to control.
The MP cost, casting time, etc is all the same as listed under the
appropriate spell heading.
