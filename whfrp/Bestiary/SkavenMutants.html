<h3>SKAVEN MUTANTS</h3>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The Skaven slave-warpers of Clan Moulder use their mastery of Warpstone
magic to create a number of mutant rat-beasts for their foul purposes.
Rat-Ogres, Tracker-Rats and Wolf-Rats are known to Human commentators, and
there may well be other mutations, less numerous or yet to be discovered.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Rat-Ogre</b><br>
<P>
Mercifully the dread Rat-Ogres are few in number. Bred for battle, they are
Skaven of immense size and strength, used as shock troops when they are
available. Of all Clan Moulder's mutants, the Rat-Ogres are the most
significant, and form a large part of the basis of the clan's power; their
control of the supply of Rat-Ogres gives them great political power, as
well as ensuring that no other clan will dare attack them.
Physique: Rat-Ogres are essentially Skaven of immense size, standing as
tall as an Ogre. They occasionally wear armour, scavenged from the
battlefield by their masters and roughly adapted to fit them. They favour
great clubs, maces and cleavers, and do not use missile weapons.
<p>
<b>Alignment:</b> Chaos.
<p>
<b>Psychological Traits:</b> Rat-Ogres cause fear in living creatures less than 6
feet tall. They themselves are immune to fear caused by creatures less than
6 feet tall, but are subject to stupidity unless controlled by a Skaven of
Clan Moulder, who must remain within 12 yards.
<p>
<b>Chaos Attributes:</b> Rat-Ogres have a 20% chance of D3 attributes, rolled on
the Dominant Attribute Table of Slaves to Darkness.
<p>
<b>Special Rules:</b> Rat-Ogres may use weapons or fight unarmed; the number of
attacks is the same in either case. They incur no penalties for fighting
unarmed. There are no Rat-Ogre Champions or Heroes.
<p>
<b>Profile:</b> The following basic profiles may be altered as a result of some
Chaos attributes.

<b>Tracker-Rat</b><br>
<P>
Tracker-rats were created when Clan Moulder experimented with sense
enhancement, and are invaluable for hunting and slaving parties. Their
sense of smell has been enhanced to an unbelievable extent, and once they
find a scent almost nothing can put them off the trail.
Physique: Tracker-rats appear to be normal Giant Rats, although they may
show some trace of further mutations. Their noses are slightly longer than
those of normal Giant Rats, but this is only noticed upon dangerously close
inspection.<br>
<P>
<b>Alignment:</b> Chaos.<br>
<P>
<b>Psychological Traits:</b> Tracker-rats are subject to stupidity unless there is
a handler within 12 yards.<br>
<P>
<b>Chaos Attributes:</b> Tracker-rats have a 10% chance of one attribute, rolled
on the Dominant Attribute Table of Slaves to Darkness.
<P>
<b>Special Rules:</b> Bite attack, 35% chance of causing infected wounds. Night
Vision 20 yards.<br>

<b>Wolf-rat</b>
<p>
In the same way as the Tracker-rats were bred for tracking, so the
Wolf-rats were bred for running down and killing prey. They are commonly
used by Skaven hunting and slaving parties, especially in the marshes
around Skavenblight. A blasphemous mixture of rat and wolf, they combine
the rat's cunning and viciousness with the power and ferocity of the wolf.
Physique: Wolf-rats are about the same size and build as one of the wolves
of the Old World, and may be mistaken for wolves from a distance. Close up,
though, their origin becomes clear. They have long, naked, ratlike tails,
and their legs, as long as a wolf's, are hairless and end in ratlike clawed
feet. Their heads are almost entirely ratlike, except that the snout is
slightly broader and more powerful, and accommodates a fearsome array of
sharp teeth. Wolf-rats are generally brown or grey in colour, although
mottled and even white individuals are not unknown.
<p>
<b>Alignment:</b>  Chaos.<br>
<p>
<b>Psychological Traits:</b> fear fire. Test psychology on the handler's
characteristics while there is a handler within 12 yards.
<p>
<b>Chaos Attributes:</b> Like Tracker-rats, Wolf-rats have a 10% chance of one
attribute rolled on the Dominant Attribute Table of Slaves to Darkness.
<p>
<b>Special Rules:</b> Bite attack. Must have a handler within 12 yards, or they
will move and attack the nearest creature.

Chaos attributes.
