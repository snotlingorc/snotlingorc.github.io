<h2>Dragon Ogres</h2>
<p>
</center>
Dragon Ogres are chaos creatures not wholly unlike the Centaur.  
<hr>
Dragon Ogres sport six limbs:  two massively muscled arms on their 
chiseled upper torso, (formed much like that of a large Ogre) and 
four scaled, reptilian legs on their 'dragon-esque' lower bodies.  
With their arms, a Dragon Ogre may fashion both armor and weapons.   
Dragon Ogres have long, scaly tails in the manner of Dragons , as 
well.
<p>
        It is thought that Dragon Ogres spend ages asleep, and that the 
only thing that can awaken one is lightning and thunder.  Legend 
has it, that Dragon Ogres can actually 'feed' on lightning to 
restore their strength.  Common mythology states, that at the 
end of the world,  Krakanroc the Black (Grand-Sire of all Dragon 
Ogre kind) will awaken as the earth is sundered by thunder and 
lightning.

<p>
<b>FEAR:</b> Dragon Ogres cause fear in creatures under 10' tall.

<p>
<b>SKIN ARMOR:</b> Because of their thick scaly hide and tough 
skin, Dragon Ogres have +1 AP on each hit location in addition to 
any armor they may be wearing.

<p>
<b>LIGHTNING:</b> Dragon Ogres are subject to frenzy if struck by lightning 
in any form (magic or naturally occuring).  Further, they can't be 
damaged by lightning strikes of any type. This includes the breath of
Blue Dragons.
