<h3>GNOMES</h3>
</center>

<p>
  <b>Psychology:</b>  This has changed in my campaign.  They're no longer
mean.  They are however, cynical, sarcastic, witty, and caustic.
This affects their sense of humor, and why they are in demand as
jesters, as sorts of harmless foils, who despite their barbed words
and twisted jokes, give a degree of incredulity to their humorous
criticisms.  What would a noble care what they're pet Gnome Jester
says, but often, they're witty asides give the noble a certain
different perspective.<br>
  The reason for this sarcasm and sense of humor are two fold.
First, it is Gnome psychology itself.  Gnomes are very aware of
appearances and realities, and the subtle nuances of both.  Allegory,
metaphors, and discrepencies between what is real and what is
perceived color their tales and jokes.  The practice of Illusions has
further implications:  What is real?  Subjective or Objective?  How
can the truth be manipulated etc...etc...
  Second:  Gnome isolation.  As outsiders, they have a different view
than others, and feel free to make scathing remarks about other
cultures under the auspices of a "joke".  They look down on other
cultures, and therefore are prone to poking fun at the silly humans
and their filthy towns.

<p>
<b>Gnome History</b><br>
  Gnomes have always worked as intermediaries between the dwarves and
others.  Often buying or acquiring dwarven raw materials, the gnomes
would craft them and sell the fine finished goods to Elves or humans.
  During the Dwarven-Elven wars, many Gnome communities attempted to
remain neutral, while the rest sided with the Dwarves.  This resulted
in many devastating battles, where the pro-Dwarven elements that
chose sides were devastated.  This was the beginning of the decline
of Gnome civilisation.<br>
  Over 500 hundred years ago, there was a sizeable Gnome population
in the hills south of the Black mountains, I believe Eric Oppen
called them the Karpathian Hills, feel free to locate them here.
&gt;From here the Gnome communities created goods and peddled in the
Border Princes.  A large Goblinoid invasion swept through, and the
Gnomes held them off, but at the destruction of most of their homes
and a tremendous loss of life.  The Largest Gnome community now
numbered a few hundred.  The survivors fled, on a exodus, away from
the Border Princes.  Their lands are now fairly empty and barren,
occupied by a few groups of humans and goblinoids.  One small
community of Gnomes persists: Bleakbearing.

<p>
<b>Gnomes Communities:</b><br>
  All communities are almost exclusively Gnomes.  Most other feel out
of place, with the exceptions of dwarves and halflings, who receive
very little needling from the Gnomes.<br>
  As artisans the gnomes are highly respected.  However, their
competition often angers human artisans, who resent their
clannishness and competition.  Various Guilds harbor hostility to
gnomes.<br>
  Most of the population isn't sure what to think.  They're always
jesting, easy going, and laughing, but nobody's sure who exactly
they're laughing at, and whether or not this joke or that joke was
really just a joke, or a scathing rebuttal!
  Nobles like Gnomes.  The Gnomes are always efficient paying taxes,
giving gifts.  The Gnomes keep their area clean, organised, and need
little or next to no assistance from the nobles.  Some nobles,
despite the productivity of the Gnomes, dislike the secretive group
well armed, and possible deceiving groups.

<p>
<b>Gnomes in the Empire</b><br>
  Gnomes are distrusted in the Empire, but their pervasive peddling,
crafting, and merchant dealings give them a high degree of economic
and financial clout, and most groups of Guilds and nobility are
afraid to limit their activities.  All communities maintain a strong
and well armed militia, which keeps humans from acting out their
frustrations on this small minority.  Gnomes pedlars, far from their
community, are often victims of crimes, or harrassed by the local
population.<br>
  Their undue influence in some areas of politics, despite their
numbers, causes resentment also.

<p>
<b>Gnomes in Bretonnia:</b><br>
  Very few Gnomes in Bretonnia.  Their communities are often in
conflict with the nobles of Bretonnia, who are constantly raising
exhoribant taxes on the only productive community in their areas, to
maintain their decadent lifestyles.  These conflicts and often turned
into small bloody confrontations, and their position in Bretonnian
society is eroding quickly, with banditry, noble resentment, and
popular agitators attacking "Gnome greed and privelage".

<p>
<b>Gnomes in Tilea:</b><br>
  Gnomes in Tilea are a stable factor in an unstable region.  More
militant and liberal than most other Gnomes elsewhere, rural
banditry, rival merchant houses, the Syndacalista, and the taxing
nobility requires that the Gnomes exert great influence on the
society.  Tilean Gnome Burrow communities are safe havens for other
non humans in the area, and many communities are mixed with halflings
and dwarves drifting in and out and working in Gnome communities.

<p>
<b>Gnome Occupations:</b>
<p>
   Of course, the most well known career are the Gnome Jesters.  Many
young gnomes, will often leave their communities for a time to drift
about with traveling troupes of Gnome entertainers who specialise in
comedic plays, pantomimes, puppet shows, etc.
  Due to their intellectual interests, many Gnomes become
philosophers outside of their communities.  Illusionists, and the
Clerics of Radandill and Ringil are popular.  Fisherman, artisans,
pedlars, and merchants are also prominent classes.  With the
exception of Ratcatcher, Fisherman, and Prospector, Gnomes may not
initially enter any Ranger career.<br>
  The most popular spellcasting career is Illusioninst, followed by
the elementalists, and then the standard wizard career.
  Diplomat is an important career for Gnomes, who always seek to get
a representative to wield some influence in local towns or noble
houses.  Witty and more prone to subtle jokes, they are often seen as
a status symbol for nobles, a way of getting a Jester for free!
However the clever diplomats machinations often bely their easy going
exterior...<br>
  Military careers are also essential, to defend against bandits and
pogroms often incited by bitter or unhappy humans, who seek an easy
way to solve their problems by using the Gnomes as scapegoats to all
their problems.

<p>
  <b>Bleakbearing:</b>  Bleakbearing was a small set of Gnomeburrows located
in the hills south of the Black Mountains.  It was the refuge of a
group of recluse and introverted Gnomes concerned with illusionist
magic and the fabric of reality.  During the Goblinoid invasion 500
years ago, Bleakbearing was saved by a cabal of Gnome illusionists
and Clerics of Randandill.<br>
  Bleakbearing are fortified Gnomeburrows hidden and concealed by the
will of Randandill and Illusionist magics, and supported by a strong
defense of Elementals.  None but the agents of Bleakbearing are
knowledgeable of it's location.<br>
  The reasons for this, is that Bleakbearing was at the time, one of
the largest Gnomic libraries, with a tremendous amount of books.
Since then, they emissaries of Bleakbearing have amassed a huge
amount of material in their search for knowledge, so that they have
one of the most extensive and dangerous libraries in the Old World,
if not the most extensive and dangerous.  Ancient history, forgotten
spells, tomes on Necromancy, Daemonology, some on Chaos.  The most
dangerous tomes are secreted in the inner sanctum of the Temple of
Randandill, and there is some speculation of how much longer even
Randandill can keep the location of so much power secret!
  The allure of all this knowledge is quite dangerous, and only the
oldest, strongest, and wisest of Gnomes are allowed to examine said
editions.  As an extra precaution, all Gnomes are only allowed to
practice Illusions and Elemental spells.  Any Gnomes with any other
knowledge, are not given entrance to the inner sanctum by Randandill.
  To acquire this collection, the Bleackbearing Gnomes send out loyal
Gnomes to acquire these works.  The Bleakbearing Gnomes have become
concerned, since many of these Gnomes haven't returned back, and
strange activities have been going on in the Karpathians.
  A schism has erupted within Bleakbearing over the future of the
library, with some dissenting members wanting to rid the library of
the dangerous tomes, while other's declare the dissenters actions as
bordering on heresy.  Any divinations in the matter to Randandill,
have proved cryptic and ambigous, which is to be expected.
  If knowledge of this library were to get out...it is certain that
Witch-hunters, Templars, Necromancers, Daemonlogists, and the forces
of Chaos would rush to the area, and some believe that these groups
are already active in the area, searching for the hidden
Bleakbearing.  Knowledge of such a library would also cast grave
doubts and suspicions on innocent Gnome communities in other parts of
the world, as the contents of the unknown library would be revealed.

<p>
<b>Randandill=Ranald, Morr</b><br>
  There is much speculation amongst the few human scholars
knowledgeable of the cult, that possibly Randandill is the Gnomic
representation of Ranald.  Support for this argument comes from the
similarity in spells between the cult: Illusionist, and similarity in
symbols: crow and the raven, and Ranald's "x" and Randandills "+" as
well as the similarity in names.  The implications of this are up to
the GM.<br>
  As for Morr, this argument is less defensible, and it centers
around the same symbol of both cult's raven motifs, and the strange
similarity in cult literature (of which there is very little for
Randandill).  The implications of this are left to the GM.

<p>
<b>Inventors</b><br>
  As described in Out of the Garden, gnomes have a predilection to
tinkering.  As well as traveling about fixing things, many become
inventors.  There are, in the archives, a Inventor Career.  I can't
remember who created it, but I strongly urge you to integrate that
career into Gnome society.  Thank you to the individual who created
it!!!<br>
  Gnomes are also prominent in a few Dwarven Engineer Guilds, where
they work as the only permitted outside freelance workers!  This is
highly rare.  They also have a prominent place in the Nuln School of
Artillery, and a number of them are specialists in the use of
Artillery.

<b>Loremaster</b><br>
  Yes, the Gnomes have a Loremaster, described in Out of the Garden.

The role of the Dwarven Loremaster is the role of an elder, and an
impartial mediator, as opposed to the Dwarven one who is a walking
library.  The Loremaster is a specialist who is approached to help
out in the community, give advice, and to ensure that everything
works out alright.<br>

<b>Storytellers</b><br>
  Storytellers are important Gnomes who travel to communities,
telling tales of the gods and Gnome history.  They'll often entertain
in towns.  The best travel singly, and their arrival in a Gnome
community is of great importance, and accompanied by great fanfare.
They are provided for by the community, and will tell tales for the
children, and later, for the adults.<br>
