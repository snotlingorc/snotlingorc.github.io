New Rules for Zombies in WFRP<br>
Made By Carsten Schwartz (c) 1994.<br>
Inspirated by WFRP play with Kenneth Madsen as GM<br>
<hr> 
The zombie is known as a strong and stubborn creature
of the night. This magical creature formed from the 
reanimated remains of human corpses never gives up. 
Although a zombie seem to be killed, it will suddenly 
live up again and attack again and again to big surprise
on any adventurer or heroes behalf. The rules in WFRP 
does not live up to this description, they appear to be
whimpy and fragile, so i made a new set of rules for 
zombies in general. These rules can be used on any 
persisten pest as the gamesmaster finds apropriate.
<p>
<b>Physique:</b> Zombies are walking corpses and carry the marks
of how they where killed. They appear in various forms of 
decomposition and will smell from bad to disgusting. 
<p>
<b>Alignment:</b> Zombies are to be considered as evil
<p>
<b>Psychological Traits:</b> Zombies cause fear in all living 
creatures they attack, but are themselves immune to 
psycological effects.
<p>
<b>Special Rules:</b> Zombies rely very much on magic to control
them, if the controller which must be a magic user dies or
is knocked down the zombie he controls is subject to stupidity
if it is hit. As mentioned zombies are very persistent in their
attack if they get a critical hit they will only die when it is
impossible to fight back. A zombie will continue to attack until
it has no arms or legs or it gets a critical hit in the body.
This means that a zombies has got to be totally immobalized to
be destroyed because even without a head and only one arm it will
still try to claw its way to any opponent and attack. It becomes 
more difficult to hit a zombie as it looses its body parts in 
combat. If an adventurer hits an arm or a leg that has been removed
in earlier combat, nothing will be hit. Zombies have a 10 \%
chance of causing Tomb Rot and 35 % chance of causing  
infected wounds.
