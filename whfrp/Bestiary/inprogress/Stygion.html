<B><CENTER>A taste of how powerful a demon prince <I>could </I>be...

<h2>Stygion</h2>
</center>
<p>
&#9;Stygion is the Lord of the Mardaags.  He is one of Khorne's most 
powerful demon princes</P>
<P>and has entered into an unholy alliance with Kossus, a powerful demon prince of Blazzach.  Together the two of them are sweeping across the southern chaos wastes and may soon overtake them.  Stygion appears as an immense, shrouded Mardaag.  He carries an enormous scythe and his eye sockets burn with a screaming fire.  Stygion's bones are blood red rather than white, and beneath his massive cloak he wears a suit of gleaming black chaos armor, the helmet from which was destroyed in a battle with Layatan, most powerful of the champions of Sigmar.  Stygion's scythe can parry all damage from one attack for each attack he spends doing so.  When the weapon hits it inflicts d6 xd6 +29 points and if a WP test is failed the victim turns to stone and is slain instantly.  Any creature of law touched by the scythe dies and can only be saved by resurrection or regeneration.  The scythe drains one point of strength per hit and fades through all armor.  The bladed end will extend on a magic chain and can be used to strike a foe 4d6 yards away.  Stygion can drain 1/5 points from any score he chooses when he hits a foe.  These points are then added to his profile until that foe dies (or 24 hours).  Any foe that is hit must also roll a WP test or contract d3 chaos attributes!  The scythe will reflect magic back at the caster if Stygion rolls his WS and after the blade has damaged a foe he does not need to roll to hit that foe again.    <B>Rewards:  </B>the Hand of Khorne (x2), Mark of Khorne, Regeneration, Aggression bonus, Personality loss, Chaos weapon (deathdealer to creatures of law, deathlust, parry, cockatrice, wraith, fade, Hacking, lashing, stealing, magic reflection, warp, vampyre; chaos armor (6 AP, runes of life, endurance, and bloodlust).  <B>Attributes:  </B>Meld into Stone, Regeneration, Growth, Viper Gout, Iron Hard Skin, Chaos Lord.  <B>Skills:  </B>strike mighty blow, dodge blow, luck.  11 AP</P>

Grishnu also has a bat like pair of reddish wings and he flies as a <I>swooper</I>.  His skin is a dead, frosty white color and he is always surrounded by a thick fog of buzzing flies.  These flies cause all foes attempting to hit him in combat to suffer a -10% penalty to their WS rolls.
