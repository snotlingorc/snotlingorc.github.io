<p>
The groke ( for it is not known if there is more than one ) is mistakenly
called the demon of cold, or frost demon. It is VERY rare. It has huge
long nose extending approxiamately to its belly button, it's arms extand
to the ground. Its hieght is about 5 feet and it is so heavily built that
it is nearly that wide. It only appears when a damonologist for some
reason halts in the middle of casting a summoning spell meant to bind a
demon. As far as can be told it enters this plain cautiously and of its
own will. It is not known if it can even speak. It usually avoids
travelers and large towns. It will approach fires, beings of fire or 
thatt breath fire and lone buildings with fires burning in them. 
It can sense fire the larger the farther away it
can sense it. A camp fire can be sensed from about a mile. While not
aggresive it is dangerous since it is intensly cold. Any one touching it 
 with there full palm and fingers takes a strenght 4 wound each round, A 
strenght check with a bonus of 20 is needed to pull the hand away ( as 
the skin will have frozen to the Groke). This will leave some flesh 
behind unless the toucher has taken 25% or more of his total max wounds 
in frost bite or is wearing gloves or gaultlets. This pull away damage 
is a strenght 5 hit. If the more than 25% of total wounds was taken 
previously then no more damage is taken when pulling away, however the frozen hand 
breaks off at the wrist. Based on the surface area of contract modify the
strenght of the damage per turn and pull away damage, and the check 
needed to pull away. Beings of fire (I.e. Fire elementals, Balruhk's) 
require no check to pull away but the amount of damage is doubled. If no 
walls or people bar its way it will sit it any availible fire ,extinguishing
the fire (its main goal in life is to get warm, a sadly impossible task.)
If provoked it will try to run and failing that will attack. Its hits 
could as the target touching it instead of causing regular damage. It 
never takes damage from fire. 
<p>
It leaves a trail of lifeless frost where goes (it has no legs as such and
glides across solid ground.) If it sits in one place for an hour or more
nothing will ever grow there again unless, a druid casts a modified
tanglethorn or other plant type life giving spell on the patch of ground. 
this spell does not produce its normal effect, it only makes the groung
capable of supporting growth again. It crosses bodies of water by standing
on the shore or bank and letting the cold it radiates freeze a peice of
water large enough for it to stand on in front of it then move forward and
repeats the process. 
<p>
Characteristics:
<dd>Not normally unstable but does not bestow this on other creatures.
<dd>otherwise normal for demon.
<dd>Its attacks count as magical.
<dd>It casts no spells.
