<h2>The Gargoyle</h2>

   The gargoyle was ommitted from the WFRP rule book, which is surprising
when its gothic origins are considered. To rectify this, and as the
gargoyle features prominently in future installments of Realm's Unae
material I present this game information for WFRP.

<p>
   Gargoyles live in nests, occasionally isolated but usually very crowded
and often found in ruins. Such an example are the Hives of Kalraith. These
communities amount to nothing less than cities, and while individually
gargoyles display only minimal intelligence they have a very good
understanding of their power as a group.
<p>
   Gargoyles attack in swarms. The average creature is tough and dangerous,
but not unbeatable. It is when they attack in waves with perhaps scores or
hundreds of fellows that they become nearly invincible. The chance of
having a second attack to deliver a killing blow on a particular gargoyle
are not worth considering when they are in such wave formations. Attacking
with raking claws, a bite and their fellows, they are truly to be feared.
Whether in the Reiklands of the Warhammer world or the northern plains of
Kalraith or fletland in Unae.
