Subject: Draka in the WFRP universe: New mutant race!
<hr>
<i>Note:</i>
This is strongly based on S.M. Stirling's excellent _Draka_ series of
science fiction novels, particularly the super-race described in _The Stone
Dogs_ and _Drakon._  I've modified them for WFRP use purely for GM's
individual use; nothing in here is intended to challenge any of Stirling's
copyrights, and it is not being done for money.

<h2>Draka in WFRP:</h2>
</center>
<p>
There are two possibilities as to the origins of the Draka.  One of them is
that they are the result of a generations-long experiment by _somebody_
(Constant Drachenfels and the Slann are two excellent candidates) mixing
human, dwarven, elven and other races' seed, and using _very controlled_
warpstone, to create the ultimate warrior race.  However, the Draka
rebelled, left and set out to take over the Old World.
<p>
The other possibility is that they fell through a warp-gate from the world
where they originated (cf. _Drakon_), and set out to conquer the Old World,
jump-start its technology, and call home.  This version has a possiblity of
any given Draka having an heirloom high-tech hand-weapon, doing damage as
per the _Fireball_ or _Lightning Bolt_ spell.

Vision, Fleet-Footed, Immunity to Disease/Poison, Lightning Reflexes,
Orientation, Sixth Sense, and Very Resilient.
<p>

Reading, Marksmanship, Read/Write, Seduction, Silent Move (Urban and
Rural), Street Fighter, Strike (all), and Wrestling.
<p>
<i>Speak</i>: Old Worlder<br>
<i>Night Vision</i>: 30 yards<br>
<i>Alignment</i>: Neutral/Evil<br>
<i>Height</i>: 5'10 + d3 inches<br>
<i>Lifespan</i>:  250 years
<p>
<i>Appearance</i>:  Tall, handsome, high-cheekboned, rather slanty eyes.  In
general, they can easily pass for humans, but have a slightly elven cast of
feature suggesting indiscretions by their ancestresses.
<p>
<i>Psychology</i>:  Great intra-racial solidarity.  Very strong drive to
subordinate or exterminate all other intelligent races.  Extreme pragmatism
as to methods used.  Hedonistic about all pleasures, but not prone to
letting pleasures take over their lives.  
<p>
Although they move freely among humans, Draka are, and see themselves, as a
separate and much better breed.  They have some specialized abilities that
make raising themselves to positions of dominance over the other races very
easy.  One of these is their use of pheromones.  Any character interacting
with a Draka using pheromonal control must make a WP roll (+5 for elves,
+10 if the character is aware that the Draka is playing games with his
head, cumulative) to avoid falling under the Draka's control.  Characters
failing this roll will do anything the Draka says (orders to do something
plainly suicidal will trigger a WP roll at +5 to shake off the control) and
characters repeatedly exposed (continuously over a period of d10 days) or
those  failing critically on their WP rolls will become the Draka's willing
slaves, obeying all orders without question.  
<p>
Draka are physically different from all other races; a "standby" heart
ready to take over if the main one's damaged, incredible resistance to
injury, blood that clots almost instantly in the event of injury, flanges
on their bones to increase the pulling power of their muscles on those
bones, and so on.  Any Physician or cleric of Shallya or Verena doing a
post-mortem on a Draka could find enough oddities to make him the hit of
the next Physicians' Guild or cult meeting.  The Draka themselves are quite
aware of this, and take precautions to keep their corpses out of the hands
of such people.
<p>
The Draka are all members of a conspiracy to take over the Old World, and
then the entire Warhammer World.  Even though they are widely scattered,
they can recognize each other instantly, and will help even a Draka they
are feuding with, if the opponent is a non-Draka.
<p>
Draka are able to consume any pleasure-drug, including alcohol, without
becoming addicted; similarly, they are as sexually hedonistic as
worshippers of Slaanesh, without ever letting it control them.  Although
they are only fertile with one another, they have no inhibitions about
sampling the favours of the "lesser" races.  
<p>
With their long lifespans and skills, Draka find rising in society easier
than ordinary folk.  Many Draka have become nobles in their own right, with
estates, in the Old World.  Their influence is impalpable, but very real.
<p>
The main weakness the Draka have is that they are _completely unable_ to
acquire Magic Points, or cast spells.  This prevents them from being any
sort of wizards, or clerics.  (Since they only worship themselves and their
own race, no Draka could become a cleric even if they could cast spells). 
Although they are trying to breed a Draka that can cast spells, until they
do, they will continue to need their human puppets.
<p>
(This race is presented as NPC opponents that are designed to give a PC
party a _very_ bad time.  Operating from behind the scenes, a Draka could
be just as frightening an opponent as a Chaos sorcerer, and much harder to
spot than a vampire.)
