<h2>Demonic creature: the Poddington</h2>
</center>
<p>
 The Poddington is a large (1m diameter) pea covered with various shapes 
and sizes of eyes and mouths.  It attacks by rolling at its opponents (it 
has no arms or legs) and biting as it rolls past (or over) them!  The 
name comes from the Poddington Peas cartoon, BTW...

<h2>Lesser demon:  the Orange Horror</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Orange Horrors are large (about 4 ft tall) carrots with arms and legs and 
a shock of wild green hair.  They *never* talk, but only ever nod, shake 
their head or shrug their shoulders.  Not that they actually have what you 
could call separate head or shoulders sections to their bodies, but they 
do things that the PCs somehow perceive as this - perhaps they actually do 
it telepathically...  Their favourite weapons are the sharpened carrots 
known as BabyCarrots (TM) which function as magical daggers and throwing 
knives.

<h2>Greater demon: the Tuberuber</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Tuberubers appear as large jacket potatoes, about 7 ft tall, with 
muscular root-like protuberances for arms and legs.  They favour the Tuber 
Whip* as a weapon and are subject to Terror of Chip Fat (:o]).

 * The Tuber Whip (I suppose it should better be called a Root Whip, but 
that doesn't seem to have the same ring to it) is a magical weapon 
otherwise like a normal whip except for the double damage that it causes.  
Tuber Whips appear to be made out of the same root-like stuff the 
Tuberubers arms and legs are made of.

<h2>Demonic steed: the Venus Mantrap</h2>
</center>
<p>
This vile creature is a large, mobile, Venus Flytrap, complete with more 
teeth that the entire Osmond family (anyone spot which well known comedy I 
'borrowed' that from?).  Branches of its thick stem are specialised to 
function as quafdropedal legs.  The demon will snap at any creature within 
range without the distinctive magical aura of demons of Quorn, and once it 
has bit it will not let go until the thing is dead (auto 1W per round due 
to digestive juices produced) or frees itself (test on half Strength each 
round, success=free, failure=D6 extra W's inflicted by the teeth holding 
the victim in place).  While holding a victim the Venus Mantrap can 
attack others with it's movement limbs and other free stem bits - treat as 
a tail lash.  Venus Mantraps are favourite mounts of Orange Horrors.

 One point a few might raise is that Quorn is apparently anti-veg, but has 
demons looking like them.  What I say is who can predict the ways of 
chaos?  Besides, these demons sparked a psychological reaction in one 
PC making him a vegetarian (the players' idea and one I saw no reason to 
not grant - the player doesn't know that's what Quorn wants...).
<p>
 Well, that's it.  Sorry about the silly content, but my campaign gets 
attacks of silliness from time to time - it helps to break the potential 
monotony of constantly fighting chaos beasties 'n things and laugh at them 
for a change... :o]  Feel free to use or abuse the Veggie demons (and 
indeed, Quuorn himself) as you wish and comments, as ever, are welcome 
(not that I'm hinting or anything...).
