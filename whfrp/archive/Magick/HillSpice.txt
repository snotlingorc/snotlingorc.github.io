 This definately requires a new name. Maybe "Law powder". It is fairly
powerful. It is either a herb or a multi-use potion. This is a substance.
Give it to PC's only in situations where you would feel justified handing
out rune weapons or some such.  When you do give it give it in large
dosage amounts This dust very simple to use and requires no tests to use.
Taking an exact number of doses is hard however and requires an INT test
and chemistry to premeasure. If taken with merely reasonible care the
player may specify how many d4's doses are taken. Each dose of it taken
will nulify the last dose of any active additive, poison, or what ever. 
Canadates include alcholic effects (one effect nulified per dose),
poisons, Magic potions, herbs etc. These effects are nullified in the 
reverse order from the order they occured in. Extremely powerful poisons 
and drugs may be exempt in which case simplely skip them in the order of 
removal.
