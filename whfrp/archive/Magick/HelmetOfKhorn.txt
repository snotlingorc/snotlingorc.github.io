Helmet of Khorne
-------------------------
Unlike most significant items of magic, this is not a unique item.  Khorne 
crafts these helms in some number, but not too many.  They are still VERY
rare.  Great warriors, who are having troubling times have been known to be
visited by Khorne in their dreams.  These dreams are always of that persons
personal conquest over vast and difficult foes, and they often wake up from
these dreams to find the helmut beside their beds, as a reminder that all
blood spilling, and battle lust bring them one step closer to the domain of
Khorne.  The helmet is jet black all over, and has a blood red full face 
visor.
The symbol of a horned skull adorns each side where the ear-hole is, the 
eyes, nose and mouth left open, so that hearing is possible.  Wearing the 
helm does not make the person Chaotic, but they do admit that Khorne
bears some influence on their lives.
