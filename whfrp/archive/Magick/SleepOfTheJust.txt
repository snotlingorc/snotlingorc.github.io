Sleep of the just
-----------------

Spell level: 3
Magic points: (the number of targets divided by 10 rounded up).
Range: variable
Duration: To gain effects sleep by the target in question must occur
between the casting and the next sunrise. the effects last until the next
sunset.
Ingredients: The dried skin and/or fresh entrails of any Chaotic being.
Saving throw: none

The area to be effected must be surrounded by a continuous border
defined by a rope of the ingredients. Any non-evil/chaotic being
sleeping in side this area rolls a d8 upon waking, if they roll equal
to or below the number of hours slept they gain +3 WP, +3 Cl, and roll a 5%
chance of begin able to ID undead. Note that the 5% is a one time roll
and either effects them for the entire day or has no effect. Remember
that all effects cease at sunset. Note that this CAN effect animals
(think Warhorse's that are even less likely than normal to balk.)
