Subject: A  magespell, too powerfull, ot not??


Rain of Unholy Fire
Spell Level : 1
Magic Points: 10
Range       : Sight
Ingredients : Gunpowder, sulphur ball, knowledge of the wherabouts of
              Morrslieb, blood from the caster, a piece of a chaotic being.

This is the newest spell researched at the Wizards guild in Altdorf. Whether
it is being legalized is yet unknown.

As the caster uses the ingredients and look directly at Morrslieb, he brings
down little pieces of warpstone from Morrslieb. This pieces catch fire when
they close up to earth.The rain falls down over an area of 10 square yards.
At level 2 it falls down over 20 square yards, but costs 20 magic points etc.
Anyone in that square is hit for D6 S5 Hits. Flammable targets take additional
D8 wounds. A successful roll against Initiativ halves the number of hits.

There is a risk using Morrslieb as a source of power. The wizard must make
a successful WP-test or gain D6 Insanity point. If a roll of 6 is made, the
caster also gain a mutation. And mutants is very often hunted down and
killed!!

My GM had the Wizards in Altdorf, (which my PC was one of for a month ago)
research a new spell, and this is what they came up with. What do you think?
I need alot of feedback on this one!
