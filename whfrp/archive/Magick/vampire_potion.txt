Vampire Potion
Duration:3d6 hours

First off NO this does not turn the drinker into a vampire. This is from
a book I read(I do not remember the author. This was invented be an
especially sadistic vampire. This allowed him to flay the skin of a
person while still keeping them alive. When the person drinks it their
wound score is temporaraly tripled (at the end of the duration divide
remaining wounds by 3 an round to nearest integer.). It also applifies
pain. This causes even minor scratches to be to feel like serious wounds
(but nothing an adventurer can't handle). If the character actuall takes
wound while under the influence of this potion then each round they must
make a number WP checks at +20 equal to the number of wounds they have
taken. If they pass they may act normally but with all percentage
characteristics and movement halved. Note that WP is immune ONLY for
the purposes of testing to see if they can do anything that round.
If they fail they spend the round falling to the ground screamming and
count as a prone target. It would OF COURSE give a huge (-30 WP???) bonus to
torture tests and of course the increased wounds to play with. Any torturer
would pay likely pay a large amount for this potion. The only problem would
lie in getting the prisoner to drink it, but any good torturer should be
able to manage this with some nose pinching and a funnel (see Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom).

As an alternate inventor Pitter Devries or Baron Vladamir Harkonen sounds
good (I hope the poster of this Dune/Frank Hubert stuff will post his
stuff to the archives)
