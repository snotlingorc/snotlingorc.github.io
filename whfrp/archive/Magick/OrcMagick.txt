           ORCISH MAGIC - BY ECHO
          -======================-
    Adapted for WFRP by Hal 'ECHO' Eccles
   -=====================================- 
 Special Rules!
-==============-
   Orc and Goblins shamens obtain their magic from slightly different 
sources to normal spellcasters. Their power comes from the raw Orcish 
magic which is generated when the Gobinoids around them get excited. 
The More orcs around the shamen the easier it is to cast spells. However 
should the shamen take on so much of this raw energy their can be serious 
side effects. NB only Orcs, Savage Orcs, Snotling fatheads and Goblins 
may be shamen the others are either too stupid or simply not interested.

 The Waaagh test;
-================-
   Instead of having magic points the Shamen gathers his energy instantly 
from the Orcs surrounding him. Thus the most magic points a shamen can 
hold is a percentage in relation to his INT and his Level. Thus:

Level 1   30% of Int is the max Magic points he can hold
Level 2   40% of Int is the max Magic points he can hold
Level 3   50% of Int is the max Magic points he can hold

1. Each TURN the Orc shamen must count up the number or Orcs and 
Goblins within 25 yards. For each Orc he gets 1 MP, for every 2 goblins 
he gets 1 MP (goblins are only half as big!). Magic points gained each 
turn are cumulative. Always round down to nearest whole number.

2. Each Orc in hand to hand combat add a further +1 MP, goblins again 
are half so two are required. 

3. At the end of each turn the shamen can choose to drain all extra MPs 
away from his body by simply touching the ground with a larger copper 
staff (which nearly all sensible shamens carry). The only other way to get 
rid of it is to cast spells.

4. If at any point the shamen moves more then 25 yards away from all 
Orcs and Goblins then no more magic is gained. BUT any magic he has 
stored already in his bubbling mind, remains.

5. If at any point the shamen exceeds the number of magic points allow 
for his level then he must take a 'Eadbangerz' test which is described 
below.

 'EadBangerz' Test
-=================-
   If at any point the shamen exceeds the number of magic points that his 
brain can hold (unlikely because of spellcasting and his trusty copper 
staff) then a 'Eadbanger test is necessary. To take an 'Eadbanger test the 
following procedure is required:

   - Take the current number of Magic points (MP) and turn it into a 
percentage i.e. 24 magic points equals 24%. If the shamen is an Orc 
(rather than a goblin) then add deduct 5% per level.
   - The shamen must then roll a D100 (percentile dice). If he rolls below 
the percentile total of magic points/level then he has failed and must roll a 
D6 on the 'Eadbanger chart. If he passes then he is safe for the time being.

 
 'Eadbanger chart 
-================-

5-6     The shamen froths a bit and loses all magic points and he cannot 
cast for d3 turns.

3-4     The shamen is knocked prone for d3 rounds by the huge amount of 
power flowing through him. He cannot cast spells for d6 turns.

 2      The shamen vomits out an explosive burst of waaargh energy 
causing the heads if any Orcs and Goblins in 10ft to explode unless they 
pass a WP test.

 1      The shamen's own head explodes in spectacular fashion - killing him 
instantly.  


 Special rules for different Orky Races
-======================================-
NIGHT GOBLINS carry around magic mushrooms with them which they 
consume adding D6 extra magic points to their total at any time.
SAVAGE ORCS add +1 to the protective power of savage Orcs tattoos 
within 25 feet increasing their save from 6+ to 5+.
FOREST GOBLINS have small venomous spiders swarming all over 
them & constantly biting them, making them somewhat resistant to 
'Eadbangs. They add +1 to their dice roll when rolling on the 'Eadbanger 
chart so they can never blow up. But every time they fail a 'Eadbangerz' 
test they are slightly overcome by the poison and stagger drunkenly for D3 
rounds unable to do anything (unless 'Eadbanger result is worse than this 
i.e. knocked prone)
FATHEAD SHAMENS have delicately large heads and thus they deduct -
1 from rolls on the 'Eadbanger chart making them more liable to explode.

 Notes
-=====-
   This is a first draft adapted largely from rules presented in Warhammer 
fantasy battle, with a few of my own bits thrown in for spice. No 
ingredients have been added largely because I didn't know what to put. 
Generally mud, squigs, beer, mushrooms, hair, toenails and other 
disgusting stuff would be used.
