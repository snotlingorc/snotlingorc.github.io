Subject: Spellcasting Initiative, Conversions.

Spellcasting Initiative
-----------------------
I thought the following system worked fairly well for me:
Spell lv  Init penelty
       P -30 I
       1 -40 I
       2 -50 I
       3 -60 I
       4 -70 I
I always thought it was odd that a Petty Magic spell takes as long to 
cast as a 4 Lv Spell.  The mage casts the spell at his Init and it goes 
off at the appropriate init (based on its level, any value below zero is 
applied to the casters Init next round).  


Conversions
----------------
I was wondering if anyone else has a method of converting WFRP -> AD&D 
2nd edition and vica-versa?  Also, does anyone have a method of 
converting the AD&D spells into WFRP?  
I have gotten tired of the WFRP spells not haveing very many applications 
other than mass destruction so here's what I came up with:
     Spells
     ------
       Wizard  Cleric  (AD&D)
WFRP P   1       X
     1  2-3     1-2
     2  4-5     3-4
     3  6-7     5-6
     4  8-9      7
The MP cost would be the AD&D level x a multiplier:
				Multiplier
  duration of spell     rounds, turns  x1
			hours, days    x2 
			weeks, months  x3
			years, Perm    x4
EX:  A 3rd level Ad&D wizard spell lasting 4 hours/level would be 
equivilant to a 1st level WFRP spell of the appropriate school and it 
would cost 3 MP (a 7th level lasting 1/hour level would = a 3 lv and cost 
7 x 2 = 14 MP.

All other properties would remain the same or be converted using common 
sense.
The GM, as always, has the final word and it is best not to duplicate 
spells that are already there.


Characters
----------
WFRP -> AD&D  (the WFRP xps are as stated in the book)
Total XPS spent since creation x Multiplier = total exps in appropriate 
AD&D class (remembering to split the xps if the ending result is going to 
be muilti-classed)
	     	WFRP xp   MULTILPIER
		10,000+	x400
		5,000	x320
		2,500	x160
		1,200	x80
 		  600	x40
		  300	x20
		  100	x10
Skills would be transfered into appropriate skills taking into account 
wpn and nonwpn slots available.  Spells would become their AD&D 
equivelants.  Stats would translate into the correct AD&D ones (taking 
into account the races min-max in both worlds and that +4/40 is the most 
one can add to a WFRP character)  
The stats would vary according to the average and max of the race 
(Make all stats 10-100 and then take the WFRP MAX and divide by the AD&D 
Max and the divide your WFRP Char by the result)
The following stats are the ones that are converted:
	STR = S      
	DEX = DEX
	CON = T
	INT = INT
	WIS = (CL + WP)/2
	CHR = FEL
(if you think the stats are too low than add 1 point per 1/10 the 
character is off of the races starting max)
All else would be determined by the AD&D (HP, wpn slots, nonwpn slots, 
specilization, etc.).
Ex:
  A dwarf that has been though bodyguard, pitfighter, giantslayer, (a 
home created class) and is now a cleric lv 1 (He represents 4 real years 
of roleplay and was my 2nd character --after my halfing physican  died -- 
who had been around almost the entire time of the campaign) would be:
6000XP x 320  = 1,920,000 exp in warrior and 500 x 20 = 10,000 in cleric
He would be a 15th level Warrior and a 4th level Cleric.
his stats would be
		WFRP	AD&D	MyCharWFRP  MhCharAD&D
	STR     8	18	 6		14     (8x10=80/18 = 4.4)
	DEX    70	17	46		11     (70/17 = 4.1)
	CON     9	18	 9		18     (9x10=90/18 = 5)
	INT    80	18	31		 7     (80/18= 4.4)
	WIS   100 	18	72(88+57)	13     (100/18 = 5.5)	
	CHR    70	17	27		 7     (70/17 = 4.1)
with the optional rule
		MYCHARWFRP			MYCharAD&D
	STR      2 (2 lower than max start)	14 + 2 = 16
	DEX	36 (0)				11 + 0 = 11
	CON 	 5 (0)				18 + 0 = 18
	INT	31 (9/10 = 1)			 7 + 1 =  8
	WIS	47 (3/10 = 0)			13 + 0 = 13
	CHR	22 (8/10 = 1)			 7 + 1 =  8
all the other items can be calculated using the AD&D system and 
converting the skills into appropriate AD&D skills.
To convert the other way just reverse the process and spend the xps to 
reach whatever career that should be the characters final career.  
(MyChar would have 6500 xps to reach Cleric Lvl 1 after going through 
some warrior careers first -- my sugestion would be to allot according 
the the division of AD&D levels, ex MyChar 15+4 = 19, 15/19 = 78%, so 78% 
->5070 (rd up) 5100 for warrior and 22%-> 1430(rd) = 1400 for Cleric).

I know that I rambled but I wanted to get this off my chest and to see 
what others thought.
