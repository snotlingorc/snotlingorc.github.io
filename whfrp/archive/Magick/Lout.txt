Lout
------
Nobody knows who created this sword, and if the crafter is still around, it 
is pretty safe that he is not proud of this creation.  Normally this would be 
considered a failure. But not completely.  Crafted to be a superb ally against 
the forces of chaos with a limited amount of intelligence, and decent 
detection abilities the wizard succeeded getting all that he asked for in that 
regard. But
only sporadically.  The process of binding a spirit to the sword slightly 
unbalanced the individual that was used.  It is a great weapon against Chaos,
but is as unpredictable as Chaos itself.  The enchantments laid on the 
sword after the spirit was trapped made the spirit subject to fear of Chaos, 
and stripped it of some of its intelligence.

	-- Will hack a downed creature of chaos repeatedly unless sword
passes an INT test to know not too.  If owner passes a LD test he can 
command sword to not hack body to bits.  If he fails, the sight of himself
mutilating the body will result in an Insanity Point.
-If FearTest is failed:
	-- Sword is afraid and will do nothing that round.  If wielder swings
Lout at creature of chaos it will not let him.  As if he failed his initial WP 

test to be able to use a magic sword to begin with, but as soon as Lout 
passes his FearTest, all the abilities mentioned above kick in instantly.
