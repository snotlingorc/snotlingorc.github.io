New Magik Rules
After testing the magic system in WFRP, one finds out that it is simple and 
consistent, if somewhat sketchy. The system works well for the spell included 
in the rulebook, but if you wish to add the spells detailed in this 
publication, and I don't see any reason why you shouldn't, you'll have to make 
some additions to the basic spellcasting rules. This is no revolutional 
redesign of the rules, but rather additions to make spellcasting more exciting 
and dynamic. Even if you don't use the new spells, and I don't see any reason 
why you shouldn't, you could find these rules interesting.

Spellcasting
A spellcaster may from now on chose between three different ways of casting his 
spells. The Normal Casting, which takes one round to complete without any 
difficulties (except those mentioned in the rulebook), the Secret Casting and 
the Quick Casting. These two additonal ways of casting spells are described 
below.

Secret Casting - When trying to cast a spell unnoticed, the magician have to 
make smaller gestures and use only whispered words. This means that the spell 
takes twice as long to cast (normally two rounds) and that the caster must make 
a WP test at -10% per level (no modification to Petty Magic) to avoid having 
the spell canceled by the lack of magic energies. Anyone observing the 
spellcaster is allowed an Observe test to notice the spellcasters activities. 
Only discrete spells may be cast this way, not physical attacks such as Magic 
Missiles.

Quick Casting - This enables the magician to immediately put the effects of a 
spell into play. It requires wild gestures and fierce shouting to enhance the 
flow of magic. Unfortunately there is a risk of the spell backfiring. The 
magician must pass a WP test at -10% per level (no modification for Pety Magic) 
not to loose control of the magic, resulting in a backfire. These backfires are 
usually the worst effects the spell can have to the caster (Fireballs exploding 
in his hands, Healing spells becomes Wounding spells and so on). If the WP test 
is passed, the magicians spell takes effect immediately in the beginning of the 
round. The spellcaster may, due to exhaustion not perform any other activity 
during the round.
Rituals may only be performed using the Normal Casting procedures.

Combined Spellcasting
With the addition of the spells in this companion, several interesting options 
of spellcombinations are opened up for the players. The first one that springs 
to mind is Blade of Fire and Shield, which if combined provides the magician 
with a powerful weapon as well as a strong defense. Should this be allowed? I 
think so, but within limits. The spells that after casting needs constant 
refueling to remain active and still allows the magic-user freedom of movement 
can be combined with other spells. This includes spells such as Blade of Fire, 
Shield, Stonefist and Flee Footed, since they only need the mental command to 
fuel the spells at the beginning of each round, leaving the rest of the round 
open for further spellcasting. The gamemaster migh on the other hand wish to 
rule that casting a spell while another is being fueled disrupts the 
concentartion of the magic-user and thereby cancels the fueled spell. In taht 
case he could consider uisng Combined Spellcasting, ruling that any spells can 
be combined and cast in one round, adding all costs and effects together and 
applying them to the caster or target. The one drawback is that the caster must 
pass a WP test for every spell involved, with a -10% penalty per spell level 
(no modifiers for Petty Magic). If he fails any of these tests, all spells 
backfire or are canceled, causing a lot of grief and frustration for the poor 
magic-user and his player. The chosen way to approach this problem is up to the 
individual gamemaster.

I'll give you an example to show you how Combined Spellcasting works. Let's say 
I wish to combine the spells Fleet Footed, Shield and Blade of Fire. The total 
MP cost would be 6, and I would have to pass a Magic test for each spell 
invoved for a total of three. All three tests are made with a -10% modifier. If 
I pass all tests, all spells take effect. If I flunk one, all hell breaks loose.

New Spells
While waiting for the Realms of Sorcery here are some new spells for all 
Wizards and their like. The style of the spells are standard fantasy, and you 
can, if you search hard enough, find the equivalents of most of the listed 
spells in other role-playing games (I won't tell you which role-playing games, 
you'll have to find that out yourselves). The object of this section is to 
provide magic-using characters and NPC's with a wide range of interesting 
spells that can be used outside the combat environment. For this purpose, most 
spells have been labled Petty Magic and Battle Magic, to make them accessible 
to all types of magicians. I have, for playtesting purposes, designed the 
spells so that some have very high Magic Point costs. This is because I think 
it is easier on the players to lower the cost after testing the spell out, 
rather than raising it.
