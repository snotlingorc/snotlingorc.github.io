Subject: [WFRP:1211] BOOZE!
                          The Drinking Binge (for WFRP)
                         -=============================-
NB. This has been Adapted from a multitude of ideas and articles about inns
and such like and follows a similar pattern to that of the 'Pelican's Pearch'
rules.

 Rules for Boozers
-=================-

   i) each time the the character has a drink the player (or GM which is more
fun) must keep a record of how many Alcohol points that character has.
  ii) When it is that the number of Alcohol points is divisible by toughness
than a Strength test is required with a penalty of the no. of Alcohol points.
 iii) Each time a test is failed the number of alcohol points in % is deducted
from all percentile scores, if the test is failed by 50% or more then deduct
one point of movement as well.
  iv) If any percentile characteristics reach zero then the charcter collapses
into a drunken stupor for d3 + no. of Alcohol points. Also the character gains
one insainity point which will lead to Alcoholism in the long term. If all the
movement is lost before percentile the PC's have lost the ability to walk, if
they attempt this they will most likely fall flat on their faces and puke up
everywhere with a distinct lack of dignity.
   v) Lost characteristics are regained at the rate of D10 per hour of sleep
or D3 per hour of activity, a severe hang-over may hamper some tasks though
such as spell casting, reading, etc...

 Example
-=======- 
(NB this actually happened in a game) Gibbons a scholar with T3 consumes a
bottle of Apple brandy (12 alcohol points) since this is 4 times his toughness
he needs to make 4 tests with a S3 (30% - 12 A.P. = 18%) unsuprisingly he
fails all four by 50% or more losing all four of his movement points. This is
where the roleplaying fun came in, since he is at a rather swanky ball
attended by lots of aristocrats. Gibbons trying to get to the privy, suddenly
realises his legs have stopped working and trips into a Duchess, promptly
being violently sick down her expensive ball gown, she wasn't too happy...

Thats made me thirsty now! If you didn't want this, tough! you've got it :-)

And Gavin <grb@psyc.nott.ac.uk> responded

I really like the rules you have given.  It makes a lot more sense that the
simple T test.  I had actually been thinking of rules for fighting whilst
drunk, did I hear anyone think bar brawl...

I had actually been thinking of modifiers for combat, but I really like the
idea of alcohol points.  I had a scheme where depending upon how much you
had drunk you would get a corresponding amount off various characterisitcs

WS BS I Dex would all get -10/1 or more as you drink
but T would be increased by 1, as you'd be too drunk to care
I had also thought about a +1 damage as you will use all your might in
hitting things.  However these T & S modifiers would only be used once the
character actually fails a drunkeness test.  This to me seems to capture
the essence of the drunken idiot swirling about himself/herself with a
chair leg....

I have also a set of modifiers for fumbles.  On the role of a natural
double the weapon you have gets dropped or embedded in something.

11 you swing violently and your blow glides over your opponent, - 10 I
22 you put all your effort into a lunge which your opponent sidesteps -20 I
33 swinging your weapon above your head spins you round lose next A
44 you smack your weapon into a chair/tree and the blow stings your hand, make
   I/Dex average test to avoid dropping it -5 WS for the numbness
55 your weapon flys from your hand, roll d12 & d6 to discover where it lands
66 you stumble, make a dex test to avoid falling otherwise lose rest of A,
   or all attacks next round if last attack
77 you manage to embed your weapon in the floor/furniture S test to remove
88 you trip on your own boots and stumble forward at your opponents feet
99 swinging wildly you manage to crash into a chair/table, take S4 hit to the
   body and only parry rest of round
00 you go for the final blow, unfortunately you hit your own leg, take
   normal damage, including S & the +1D (embarassing way to die....)

Maybe these are a little extreme, but then you are drunk...

Well they are my modifications for the periluous act of drunken combat
Comments please
