I've been following this discussion of fate points with some interest,
since I've been playing games with fate points of one kind of another
for 10 years now. (Remember TSR's original Top Secret? Fame and
Fortune points? I got into plenty of arguments over those, I can tell
you.)

My *personal* opinion on the situation is this:

Question: 3 opponents gather behind the character and attempt to
behead him/her. How many fate points should he/she use?

Answer: None. The character is *dead*, unless (by some miracle of dice
rolling or particularly incompetent executioners) the character
manages to survive being hit three or more times.

Let's face it folks: Call 'em fate points, or call 'em "fame and
fortune points": they're *not* a cure-all for bad judgement on the
part of the player/character. Any player who gets themselves into this
situation deserves to get hurt or even killed.

The only real time fate points should come into play is when a
character actually has a fighting chance to survive, but through
particularly unlucky dice-rolling he/she ends up defeated (or worse,
dead) anyway. That's when a lucky character can save him/herself with
fate points.

There are still plenty of ways to keep the character alive while
factoring fate points out of the equation. Maybe the opponents aren't
really there to kill the character at all, and instead they _Strike to
Stun_. In that case, the character would still go unconscious and the
player would not know what was going on... resulting in some truly
interesting suspense as the other characters search for their lost
compatriot, fearing the worst.

Realistically (as far as that goes in a fantasy game...:), the players
shouldn't even *know* how many fate points they have, and they might
not even know when the GM decides to use one for them. Their character
is the beneficiary of several "lucky breaks", which may or may not
have anything to do with fate, or the gods, or the player's decision.

It seems to me that any game where the GM and players are arguing over
"how many fate points to use in XXX situation" has begun to degenerate
into something resembling... dare I say it... AD&D!
