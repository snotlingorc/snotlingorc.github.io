There's a new funny skill from Polish magazine "Talizman". While it doesn't
change things much, it gives a cool narrative opportunity.

 Neat blow: a western-style blow, after which victim flies along the ballistic
 curve, showing his/her boot size and falling with loud "thump", creating a
 cloud of dust (regardless of weather and other conditions). Of course,
 victim is also knocked out for D3 rounds.

Same source, new rule proposal.

 For unarmed combat, if both fighters are unarmed, normal penalties are
cancelled and appropriate skill gives +10 bonus. Normal damage is ignored,
only extra damage is considered - multiplied by 5 it's treated as percentage
chance of KO (change multiplier for "fragile" hit locations).

 BTW: I'd also count Strength effect for Str of 7 or higher.
