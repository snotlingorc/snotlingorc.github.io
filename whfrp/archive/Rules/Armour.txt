Subject: WFRP: New armours

Hi guys!
Sorry that I`m late ,but I was ill and  so I couldn`t get to my 
internet. Now lets begin.

Riveted Armour
--------------
Riverted armour is made up from lether and it`s cover by metal things 
like rivert ,circles and so.

There are three kinds of it.
* Riverted doublet gains 0/1 AP to a chest.But it has increased damage 
limit up to 6 pionts of damage (leather has 3 for example).
* Riverted jacket 0/1 AP to a chest and arms.
* Riverted coif defends head 0/1 AP

Cost of "upgrading" this armour is 3gc for chest and 1gc for each 
reamining part of body.(Don`t forget to add this to price of leather 
armour).Weight points are:chest +15,arms +10,legs +10 (for each) and 
head +5 (it`s noumber which must be add to leather items).

Scale-armour.
-------------
It works almoust the same as riverted and leather armour but this 
type of armour resist to 10 points of damage.(0/1 AP up to 10 dp).
I`ve created three kinds of it.

* Scale-doudlet defends only chest (and a back of course) cost 25gc
weight: 60p.
* Scale-jacket defends chest and arms , cost 30gc weight: 65p.
* Scale-tunic defends chest ,arms and legs ,cost 55gc weight :75p.
