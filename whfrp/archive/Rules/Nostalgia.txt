Subject: A spell for preists of Alluminatis(sp?)

Name: Nostalgia
Level: petty or 3rd depending on who you ask

Ingredients:
set-up: 1 ounce of hair(* see additional limits below)
trigger: none

Magic points:
set-up: 1 every other hour for 48 hours.(If the caster has the points to 
cast the spell to begin with he won't need to roll for mana 
exhaustion)
trigger: 1

Range: 
set-up: Touch or personal
trigger: 30 yards. LOS.

Set-up: the target must be unclothed during the casting of the spell. If
the target , blinks, defecates, sleeps, urinates, moves conciously in any
way, eats, drinks, talks except to speak the spell etc. To stay this still
and still be awake either requires lots of will power checks, the
encasement of the target in a body cast, or a alchemical or magical potion
of paralysis. The chanting is only needed for five minutes every hour so
going horse is not a problem. When the spell is complete right down
EVERYTHING releivant about the characters mental, bodily physical and
spiritual state. Include XP, BUT EXCLUDE magic points, and FATE POINTS!!!
Specifically included are hunger and thirst levels (high after going
without for two days) the ABSENCES of poisons, auras and other magical
effects and drugs (NOT there presences, this becomes important later). Set
this record aside. 

Trigger: When triggered all of the targets stats and memories revert to 
there status when they were recorded during the last time the set-up 
portion was cast on the given target by the priest casting the trigger 
spell. Note that while this can remove poisons etc it can not add them, 
they will survive only if the given effect is present at the time of the 
trigger spell and was present at the completion of the set-up spell.
