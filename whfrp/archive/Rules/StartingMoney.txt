Subject: WFRP starting money

I feel that the starting money for careers could be improved to reflect the career chosen. 
If you use the social standing (White Dwarf 138) then you could use the method I do. 
Classes are rated A through to D. A being the nobility, D being the labouring and crimminal
class.

The noble class stays the same 2d6 + the 3d6 starting money.

B class, the professional academic class get the standard 3d6
starting cash + if the carreer is a d4 roll for social level add d10 shillings, 
if its a d6 then d10+4 shillings.

C class careers roll 3d6 shillings instead of the usual 3d6 gold plus ant money 
noted under the career is also in shillings.

D class careers roll 1d6 shillings + 1d10 pennies.

This I hope shows the great differnces in the social table of the Old World. Of course 
anyone can make changes to these I just used this quick system to start a new campaign.
