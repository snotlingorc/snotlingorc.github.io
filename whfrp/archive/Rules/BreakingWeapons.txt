Hi all,
    I'm relatively new to the list but I thought I'd post my rules for 
breaking weapons.  The system is really simple because I feel weapon 
breaking should not occur all that often and definitely should not 
take up much game time.  Basically I only check to see if weapons 
break during a parry in the following situations:
    1) When their is a difference in strength of 3 or more.
    2) When the character parrying rolls a '01'.
I only check for armour breaking 
    1) on the roll of a '01' to hit.
    2) when the attacker's S is 7 or greater.   
 Anyway, once you have determined that a break may occur check to see 
if it does.  A break occurs on the roll of a '1' and the quality of 
the weapon/armour dictates what die is rolled. 
Wooden weapons               D4
Metal weapons/armour         D6
High quality weapons/armour  D8
Dwarf forged weapons/armour  D10
Mithril weapons/armour       D12
Magic weapons/armour         D20-D100 
Magic Artifacts              D100

I admit the system is not very elegant but it works well.  I 
have rules for sword breakers, I'll post them if anyone is interested.
