One caveat - be aware that it's to some extent still a framework.  For
example, not all the "chemicals" I came up with are used in the Specifics
I've documented - they're there for my own convenience as pegs on which to
hang future recipes if I feel it's appropriate.

(It's worked, to date - it kept the player in question active and interested
during the more frustrating portions of Power Behind The Throne, at least.)

Drug Manufacture

Drugs ("Specifics") are similar to herbs in their descriptions and range of
effects. However, there are also a number of differences.  Firstly, 
Specifics may be purchased at a price from a number of sources, eg a
local alchemist (although I suspect in this case a better term would be, 
"apothecary") or Physician - someone with the time and skills to make
them up. Such sources will normally only be found in the larger towns and
cities. It will almost always be cheaper by a factor of 2 or more for a
player to manufacture Specifics themselves from raw ingredients, than to
purchase them already compounded.

Alternatively, characters with the *Manufacture Drugs* skill may
compound Specifics for a range of effects themselves, provided they
are able to acquire the correct ingredients.  Such ingredients will
normally be either herbs or Chemicals, as fits the skill description.

Herbal ingredients can be obtained from the normal sources (eg a
herbalist), and used to produce Specifics with properties identical to
their herbal equivalents (as described in "The Enemy Within").  Such
preparations will normally be easier to use than their herbal
equivalents, and will retain their properties for much longer (ie
semi-indefinitely).

Chemical ingredients will normally require prior preparation by a
character or NPC with the *Chemistry* skill.  Preparation of a
Specific requires a successful Int role; failed preparations may have
unexpected effects at the GMs discretion (although normally these
would be broadly in line with the Specific's intended properties).


For every Chemical-based Specific, the following factors are defined:

Availabilty (compounded):
        The availabilty of the Specific in prepared form.

Price (compounded):
        The price of *ONE* treatment of the prepared Specific "over
        the counter" (remember that some drugs may not be readily available,
        and may even be subject to local legal controls).  *NOT* to be 
        confused with the cost of preparing one *batch* of the Specific (see
        below), which may well yield several treatments-worth.

Method of Application/Dosage/Skills/Tests/Effects:
        As for herbs

Recipe:
        The Chemicals required to concoct the Specific (normally 1+1d3
        components; some of these may occur more than once).

Preparation:

        As Herbs

Attention:

        The degree to which the preparation must be monitored.
        Attention will be categorised as:
        "Low" - The preparation can safely be left unattended for long
        periods (say, over a low flame)
        "Medium" - The preparation must be checked regularly (say,
        once an hour), and longer periods of attention will be necessary from
        time to time (say, two hours per day).  The checking can be delegated
        to a suitable individual with appropriate skills (say, a physician's
        apprentice) with a -10% modifier to the final INT check for success.
        The longer periods of attention require skills that cannot be
        delegated.
        "High" - The preparation requires constant attention - the
        character preparing the Specific is effectively unable to do anything
        that will take them away from their job for more than a few minutes.
        If the preparation takes more than a day, it may be necessary to
        arrange for a servant or apprentice to wake the character at regular
        intervals during the key stages.

If a character wishes to prepare more than one Specific at a time, the
success roll for *each* specific being prepared must be reduced as
follows:
        For every other "Low" Attention Specific being prepared: minus
        5% per Specific.
        For every other "Medium" Attention Specific being prepared:
        minus 15% per Sspecific.
        For every other "High" Attention Specific being prepared:
        minus 30% per Specific.


Yield:
        The number of treatments prepared in a single batch by
        following the recipe.  Players should be allowed to scale the recipe
        up or down within reason; however, for every factor above one  by
        which the recipe is scaled up or down, a 10% negative modification
        should be made to the INT test for success.  (Thus, a player with an
        INT of 54 trying to prepare three times the recipe quantity of a
        Specific (ie two extra lots) at one go would roll against a modified
        INT of 34 (= 54-2x10)).  A player may always opt to prepare multiple
        batches of a single Specific in parallel; in this case, each batch 
        is treated as a seperate Specific when calculating the Attention
        modifiers (above) to be applied to the final INT roll for success.

======================================================================

Chemicals:

On the Naming Of Chemicals:

For the record, the name given to a Chemical is that by which it is known to
practising Alchemists and related trades; it may or may not have anything 
to do with its actual nature.  "Dragon's Milk", for example, is so called 
because of its appearence, namely a white-ish liquid flecked with 
blood-red particles.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with real dragons.
(Mind you, if the player are asked to get some, and don't know any
better...)


Preparing Chemicals:

Chemicals can be prepared by a character with the *Chemistry* skill
from raw components (ores and the like).  For simplicity, it is
assumed that each Chemical requires only one raw component, and that
the components have the same availability as the Chemical.  Enough raw
ingredient to make one unit of a Chemical can be purchased at a base
price of 20%-50% of that of the prepared Chemical.  Time to prepare is
shown below; where this is given as "(none)", the chemical does not
require special treatment before use.
