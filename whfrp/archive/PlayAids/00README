The art included here is part of an exercise by Tomas Fjetland
(tomasf@telebyte.nl) and Danny Willis (goblin@hitech.net.au) to provide
visual stimulation for GMs to use in their WFRP adventures.  We found that
the archives provided a great deal of excellent text material so we felt
that our contribution could be to present various images of places that
could be found in the Warhammer world.
But the concept doesn't stop there.  What we are asking players to do is,
if they use the images provided for their WFRP adventures then perhaps they
could contribute their experiances, ideas, storylines even additional art
to Tomas and we'll include them in Tomas' site and eventually (with the
blessing of the Warhammer Gods) to the archives.
So, if you're campaigning in the depths of the Empire or searching for the
kidnapped son of a wealthy nobleman in the ruins of a dark elf fortress or
whatever, you may find an image here that could suit your purposes.  If you
use the image and the storyline that comes from develops into an exciting
story, let us know.  Tomas will put it up on his site and others can use
your ideas.  The more input we receive the better the site will be and
consequently the better the images will become.  There's nothing like your
input to spur we artists on to bigger and better things.

How's that sound?  I'm not to good at these things, not too wanky?
Tomas will probably want to update this at some stage and include the
address of his new WWW site - when he gets one.
Thanks Thomas
