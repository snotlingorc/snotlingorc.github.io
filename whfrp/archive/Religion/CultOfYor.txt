Subject: [WFRP:1306] The Snotling Cult of Yor

Hi all,
We did this whilst we was under the influence of alcohol, so don't moan
because it "doesn't fit in with the dark aspects of the warhammer world" it
was intended a a bit of fun...

 The Snotling Cult of Yor
-========================-

The snotling cult of Yor has established for more years than any snotling can
remember. It is a mysterious organisation run mainly by the Fat-heads (see
below) despite the primal and unruly snotling behavior, the Fat-heads manage
to control their lessers by their baffling intelligence. The snotling cult is
nomadic, moving from place to place and capturing more young snotlings ti be
drafted into the ranks of Yor. It is the snotling priests of Yor with their
outstanding martial arts skills (a blessing from Yor) that are the front to
the cult, yet many have never heard of them.

 Yor - God of Snotlings
-======================-
Description= Yor (in snotling pictograms) is basically depited as a Large
snotling wearing full plate armour and carrying a large staff. Not much is
known about him but he clearly existes and blesses his little followers.

Alignment= Neutral/Evil

Symbol= All priests of Yor wear black robes (or very dirty ones)

Area of Worship= Only the cult of Yor is known to worship this Diety.

Temples= The every moving altars of the cult of Yor is the only temples that
Yor has.

Friends/enemies= the enemies of the cult of Yor.

Cult requirements= must be a snotling.

Spell use= none (unless Fat-head shamen).

Blessings= snotlings who show devotion to Yor are imediatley blessed with the
Martial arts skill (like streetfighting)

 The Fat-Heads
-=============-
The Fat-heads were once normal snotlings before they came into contact with
warpstone. This had a strange effect upon them, it increased their
intelligence so they could reason, theorize and do things most Orcs would find
painful of the brain. All Fat-heads are in the cult of Yor for it was he that
showed them the way...

Physique - Because of their increased intelligence there brains are bigger.
Thus they have swollen bulbous heads twice the normal size (which looks
remarkably funny)

alignment - Neutral/evil

Psychological traits - as with a normal snotling.

Special rules - They have the particular skill at being able to expound huge
and very complicated (& baffling) theories (in much the same way as a Quantum
Physisist)this can lead to opponents to be baffled for a round thus allowing
the Fat-head to make a clean getaway

NB- They are better because they are generally the leaders.

 Fat-head Characters and Shamens
-===============================-
Fat-heads are the intellectual leaders of the Cult of Yor. They, in the words
of the Psy-goblin, are like melons on pencils in appearance because there
heads are swollen to hold their massive brains. They also make adept shamens
as the warpstone that tainted them so many eons ago makes their blood flow
with magic, the powerful shamen lords have to be carried around by their loyal
snotlings as their little legs cannot support the weight of their massive
heads, they generally have a chair carried by four ninja snotling bearers.
