                         Extended Rules WFRP
               Concerning "Mercuri, God of Explosions"
                         By PC Ruud Lubbers

Name: Mercuri, God of Explosions

Descriptions: Mercuri is the God of Explosions. He controls
the bombs and other stuff. He's often portrayed as a small
dwarf who is bold. He were's an armour, and he has a small
tatoe between his thumb and his forefinger of a bomb.
The cult is ment for the alchemist who are to happy in 
placing bomb's or other stuff like that. They are not welkom
in the other Cult for alchemists, because they are not real
alchemists who make potions and chemical stuff.

Alignment: Mercuri is a Neutral/Evil diety.

Symbol: Clerics of Mercuri wear black robes, and often they
wear the symbol in red on there left shoulder. Everybody who
worships Mercuri has a tatoe of the symbol between there
thumb and forefinger.

This is the symbol:


Area of worship: Mercuri is worshipped throughout the Old
World, but his followers are often dwarfs or humans.
In every city there is an alchemist who worshipped him.

Tempels: None (at this moment). You can pray to him in an
alchemist store.

Friends and Enemies: The Cult of Mercuri is a friendly cult
if you like explosions. Often the rich people hire alchemist's
to help on the battle field. Followers of Solkan are hated
simply, because they hate explosions.

Holy days: every full moon is a holy day, because a full
moon looks like a bomb. Then they must let a bomb explode
and pray for 1 hour.

Cult requirements: The Cult of Mercuri has no specific entry
requirements.

Strictures: - must wear 1 bomb every where they go, except
              if you are captive. (the bomb must be 100 gr
              gunpowder)
            - try to be bold
            - always help eachother in making more power-
              full bomb's (A-Bomb!!!!!)
            - try to go every 6 full moons to Altdorf for
              a speciale bomb meeting.

Spell use: Clerics of Mercuri can learn every spell, if 
there is an explosion in it or something like that. 
(example; fireball, lightningbolt)


Blessings/skills: - sw. firearms
                  - sw. bomb
                  - sw. incendiaries(?)
                  - luck (you'll need this one)
                  - supernumerate
                  - chemistry
                  - + 10% on BS

Trails: You can let him blown something BIG up. (example
an army of Chaos)
