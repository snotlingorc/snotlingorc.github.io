Maddi Friedhof is the daughter of Karl Kirchhof, who was a wizard and
necromanceer.  She was raised by her father in his hidden magical
laboratory, and trained to assist him to the limit of her abilities, hence
the academic skills she has.  Her father was killed by adventurers, and
Maddi was confined by the priests of Morr until they were satisfied that
she knew no Necromantic magic; they couldn't legaly burn a nine-year-old
girl just because she was her father's daughter.  Upon her release, she was
placed with an old couple (distant relatives) in Middenheim.

However, she _was_ Morbid, and soon took up the habit of hanging around
Morrspark as much as she could.  In her black cape, black beret, black
sweater, black stockings, black clunky boots, plaid knee-length skirt and
skull neck pendant, she soon became a fixture in Morrspark.  She now knows
the place as well as anybody, and can point out any grave or tomb and give
a short description of the person buried within.

The old couple with whom she lives are alcoholic, and exert little control
over Maddi, so she runs with a gang of orphaned and abandoned children most
of the time.  Her spooky reputation does a lot to scare off those preying
on her friends, and she is not above using her skills as a sort of low-rent
"ninja" to get back at enemies.  

One thing that worried the priest of Morr about her was the fact that
although her hands were perfect in all other respects, there are only three
fingers and the thumb on each hand.  She has taken to claiming that her
hands were maimed as a baby, and usually keeps them hidden as much as
possible.  The former Emperor's edict against mutant-burning is still law,
but Maddi knows that there are a lot of people who would love to burn her
both for who her father was and for what she is.

(Note:  Maddi Friedhof is based on the character "Maddie" in _The Big Book
of Death,_ from Factoid Publications.  "Maddie" is the narrator/guide in
the sections of the book dealing with various famous cemeteries.  I include
this so that people who want to use her in campaigns know where she came
from and can get a better idea of just what she looks like.)

Adventure hooks:  Maddi could be kidnapped, either by would-be necromancers
who want her to tell them where her father kept his sorcerous tomes, or by
people who think she's a necromancer herself (she IS rather pale). 
Adventurers could either be the kidnappers or rescue her.
