Hi all,
Heres a NPC savage orc who I used in my campaign (the one with loads of savage
orcs :-)) he is big and hard and should not be approached under any
circumstances 'cause he is armed and dangerous.

-----------------------------------------------
DROLAG MANCLUBBA - savage orc Warlord.

4  63  45  5  5  16 50 4  49   61  28   59  57  18   1 (?)

Special rules; has all characteristics of savage orcs (details in ARCHIVE)
including; tribal tattoos and Frenzy. He is the leader of the 'broken skull'
tribe of savage Orcs who are very promenent in the dark lands.

Skills;  Specialist weapon - 2-handed, Flail,
         Warrior instinct (this isn't really a skill just represents
experience and instinct on the battlefield)
         Speak additional Lang. - Old Worlder
         Immunity to poison
         Public speaking (in order to talk to his hordes)

--------------------------------------------------

With Drolag though it was a case the bigger they are the harder they fall as
he was eventually killed when a brave troll slayer threw himself and Drolag
over a big cliff killing them both (or is Drolag still wandering round some-
where dazed and one fate point down after landing in a convienent pond....).

Cheers,

ECHO
