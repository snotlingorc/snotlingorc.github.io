Pfirsich Marie Wustenfuchs is the sister of Erwin Wustenfuchs, one of
Emperor Heinrich X's greatest generals.  She is also a soldier, but would
much prefer to lead a peaceful, quiet life; despite her profession, she is
the next thing to a pacifist.  She is in charge of an Imperial Army
recruitment and training centre, and is an excellent officer in her own
right.  

Although she will go to great lengths to avoid fighting, when forced to do
so or sufficiently provoked, she will make whoever started the fight very
sorry indeed.  A tall, elegant blonde, she is quite concerned about her
appearance and takes a personal, almost motherly interest in all of her
subordinates.  She is a devoted sibling to her famous brother Erwin, and
the two of them are very close indeed.

Quotable Quote:  "Darlings, I know that we're out on campaign, but that
doesn't excuse me from being a civilized human being.  Let me finish
getting my face on and we'll have a nice cup of tea."
