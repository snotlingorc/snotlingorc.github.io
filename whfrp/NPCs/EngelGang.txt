Elmer Engel was exiled from the territory of Middenheim for a period fo ten
years, nearly thirty years ago.  With his sons, he headed out on travels of
which he does not speak now.  When his exile was over, he returned and
settled down in Warrenburg, but soon found it advisable to leave.  Settling
in the forest near Norderingen, he and his sons soon became the terrors of
the neighbourhood.  

"Link" Engel--Outlaw

Language--Battle Tongue and Thieves', Spot Trap, Strike Mighty Blow, Strike
to Stun, Drive Cart, Ride Horse, Frenzied Attack.
Special Rules: Subject to _stupidity_ if operating alone.

"Link" Engel is one of the sons of "Vati" Engel (see above) and is a
brutal, remorseless killer in his own right.  He obeys his father in all
things.  If separated from his family members, he is subject to
_stupidity._  He often teams with his brother "Maschine", who is the single
person in the world to whom he's truly close.

"Junger" Elmer Engel---Human Male, Outlaw

M 4 WS 42 BS 43 S 2 T 3 W 8 I 33 A 2 DEX 34 LD 27 INT 26 CL 46 WP 35 FEL 35

Skills: Concealment Rural, Disarm, drive Cart, Dodge Blow, Scale Sheer
Surface, Secret Language--Battle and Thieves', Set Trap, Ride Horse, Silent
Move Rural, Spot Trap, Strike Mighty Blow, Strike To Stun, Marksmanship,
Torture.

Appearance: Scroungy, badly shaven, lank greasy hair.  Wears round-topped
hat.

Junger Engel is the youngest of the Engel brothers (19) and his father's
favourite.  Despite his youth, in many ways he is the worst of the lot.  A
viciious sadist, he likes torture for its own sake and will "indulge" at
every opportunity.
 Being smarter than "Maschine" and "Link," he will usually take command in
the absence of theri father.  He is very close to their father and devoted
to him above all other people.

"Maschine" Engel---MUTANT

M 4 WS 38 BS 22 S 7 T 7 W 8 I 38 A 2 DEX 31 LD 22 INT 15 CL 89 WP 89 FEL 19

Mutations (as per WD 99): Mechanical Arm (S+2, AP 2), dial on head with
four settings: 
1: S+1, Frenzied Attack
2: S+2, Frenzied Attack
3: S+3, Frenzied Attack, A+1
4: S+4, Frenzied Attack, A+2

Subject to _stupidity_.

Skills: Concealment Rural, Flee!, Fleet-Footed, ID Plant, Street Fighter,
Strike Mighty Blow.

During the Engels' travels, they headed into an outshoot of the Chaos
Wastes.  Although "Vati," "Link," and "Junger" were not particularly
effected, "Maschine" and his brother "Fink" were.  One reason the Engels
settled where they did was because with two mutants in their family, they
could not live with other people.

"Maschine" works, by preference, with his brother "Link."

"Fink" Engel---MUTANT

M 6 WS 29 BS 33 S 4 T 2 W 7 I 39 A 2 DEX 34 LD 21 INT 30 CL 39 WP 38 FEL 10

Mutations: Skull Face (causes _fear_ in opponents unless save is made vs.
WP), Very Skinny (T -1) Poison Bite (delivers 1 dose Manbane per bite)

Skills: Specialist Weapon (Sling) Acute Hearing, Animal Care and Training
(rats), Concealment Rural, Escapology, Flee!  Fleet-Footed, Frenzied
Attack, ID Plant, Immunity-Poison and Disease, Night Vision, Prepare
Poisons, Set Trap, Silent Move Rural, Street Fighter, Very Resilient, Swim,
Spot Traps.

Lives in:  Tunnels beneath Faustschlag.

Like his brother, "Maschine," "Fink" Engel was mutated during the Engels'
exile from Middenheim.  His mutations were less severe than his brother's,
but they were sufficient to prevent him living among normal society.  He
developed a compulsion to sleep underground whenever possible, and after
finding a way into the Faustschlag's tunnel system, he more-or-less
separated from his family.  However, he still keeps in touch, and any
injury to them will bring him down on the guilty party.  About the only
"Engel" virtue is family loyalty, and "Fink" has his full share of it.

He has a pet mutant Giant Rat with a bite that delivers 2 doses of Manbane,
and which is teaching him Queekish.
