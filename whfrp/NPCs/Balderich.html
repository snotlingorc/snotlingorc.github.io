S Balderich (Nobody knows his first name, but he thinks it's 'Sod off',
because when he used to play in the gutter, he'd tell the other snipes:

efforts bring disaster in their wake.  He might just do for shovelling
manure, as long as someone smarter than he is, such as a snotling, is put
in charge of him to prevent him indulging in his habit of eating it.

He is Edmund von Schwarzenatter's servant, mainly providing his master with
a butt for invective.

<b>Description:</b>  short, peers nearsightedly, looks suspiciously like a monkey

<b>Quotable quote:</b>  "Mein Herr, I have a cunning plan to save us from being
