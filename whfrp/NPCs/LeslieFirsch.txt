Subject: WFRP: NPCs, as promised

As promised, here are some NPCs to use in your next game.  

Leslie Fisch (Human female)
Minstrel (ex: Student, Agitator, Demagogue, Troubadour)

M 4 WS 50 BS 42 S 3 T 3 W 9 I 51 A 2 Dex 39 Ld 50 Int 45 Cl 58 WP 52 Fel 88

Skills: Arcane language (Magick), Read/Write, Secret Language (Classical),
History, ID plants, Speak Estalian, Public Speaking, Blather, musicianship
(Lute), Sing, Charm, Ettiquette, Specialist Weapon (Pistol, bombs), Very
Resilient.

Description:  Tall, rawboned, dark-tanned skin, long, straight black hair.

Leslie Fisch is a member of the New Millenialists, a revolutionary society
dedicated to overthrowing the corrupt, Chaos-influenced rule of the
nobility and establishing a society based on justice and reason.  It is
severely opposed to the Forbidden Gods (Chaos and Khaine) but is forbidden
itself, due to its subversive beliefs.

As a singer working the taverns of the Freiburg district of Middenheim, she
makes a point of slyly slipping anti-authority plugs into her songs, which
are quite popular with the student radical crowd.

Quote: "The Imperium is like a rotten oak...mighty to look at, but feeble
and hollow inside."

Weapons carried: Dagger, pocket pistol.

(Note!  This NPC is directly based on the well-known filksinger and
songwriter Leslie Fish.  Nothing I say about this NPC is intended to be a
direct depiction of Leslie, although I don't think she'd be particularly
displeased by the way I've placed her counterpart in the Warhammer world.)
