Notes: He does not lard his hair, and baldness has stripped the front half
of his crest. He Is grim, officious, and tempered like an old drill
seargeant. He rises at dawn, and is about his days buisiness by an hour
later, and will be drunk within 2 hours of finishing his tasks for the day.
He will be friendly to all who treat him with respect, and bop upside the
head ANYONE rude in his presence (not for damage if he makes his cool
check.)
