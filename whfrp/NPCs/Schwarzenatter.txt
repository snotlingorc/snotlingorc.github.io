Edmund von Schwarzenatter is the son of exiled Albionese nobility.  He
lives in Middenheim, ostensibly off the revenues from some estates.  In
fact, he is a ranking agent ofthe Middenheim Freistadt Innere- und Aussere-
Sicherheitsburo---the Middenheim secret police and espionage service.  With
his noble background, he is able to infiltrate plots among the nobilitiy,
and visit neighboring Electoral courts and the like without attracting
particular notice.  His two stupid sidekicks---Freiherr Schwantz von
Schwantz (descended from another exiled Albionese nobleman, Lord Percy
Percy) and his incredibly dim servant, S. Balderich, also distract
attention from him with their incredible dumbness.

Special Rules:  Must save vs. Cl or get silly haircut when severely
traumatized. 

Description: Pale skin, large dark eyes, thick curly black hair, curly
black beard, always wears black-on-black clothing.

Quotable Quote:  "Balderich, that 'cunning plan' of yours is easily the
stupidest idea I've ever heard of since your 'cunning plan' to only make
love wearing clothes to ensure that the baby wouldn't be born naked."
