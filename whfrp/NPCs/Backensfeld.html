<h2>Richard Backensfeld</h2>
</center>
Age 45
<P>
Richard's father was named Camrin. Camrin was a above average free lance,
this problably due to the fact that early in his carrier(before his
marrage and the birth of Richard) by a stroke of great luck he saved a
high ranking wardancers life. Out of gratitude the wardancer promised to
give Camrin whatever he asked within certian limitations which he stated.
Camrin in all inoucence asked for something that the elf had not excluded
from the bargain because it had never occured to him that anyone would be
so brash. Camrin asked that as long as the elf lived Camrin and his
decendants would be allowed to enter the wardancers' compound. In the end
the elf agreed but with stipulations to protect the secrecy of the
location of the elf city and a conditions that the humans not speak in the
compound and hide their faces and forms under robes so that they would be
merely mysterous strangers rather than obviously human. It was never in
question that Richard would follow in his fathers foot steps and he
excelled with the sword, he had a most unusual style, influenced as it was
by the elves. It was truely a joy to watch him train. His motions were
increadiably fluid. Yet he at this point he had never seen a battle.  He
studied sword play only in the abstract. When he was 14 he had learned all
that he could for the moment needing only more practice and the time to
grow into his full strenght, resiliency and reach. He search around for
some means of making some extra money and a change of pace. Wandering
around town he met a hypnotist woand they fell to discusing the posiblity
of an apprenticeship in a friendly manner. In actual fact the hypnotist
did not really have the excess customers for Richard to practice on. In
the discussion the hypnotise asked what Richard could do. Richard led the
hypnotist to a feild and began doing sword exercises. The hypnotist saw a
way to improve his businesses renown and his own fame. He took Richard in
immeadiately and they worked together to develop a form of hypnotism based
on entrancing sword exercises and the play of light on the sword's blade
rather than on the rythem of a pendulum. The skeme worked and they got
much free advertising from the stories of Richards unusual methods. Then 7
years later the long peace was shattered and Richard and Camrin rode off
together to war against Chaos. Due to his lack of employment Camrin had
been putting off buying a second war horse. Fortunitely the fighting was
in the preliminary scouting and probing days of the battle and of course
someone had gotten themselves killed, freeing up a war horse. Richard
bought this horse. Richard never really got to know this horse since he
sold it again within the month. The reason for this was that his father
was seriously injured in the battle and never fully recovered, which was
unsurprising given that he was missing his left hand. This plus this being
Richards first battle and that during the battle a demon mind controled
several hundred small children that the chaos forces had captured just for
the purpose into suicide attacking the unit that Richard and Camrin were
in drove Richard over the edge. He hated the concept of fighting from that
day forth, although ironically this only passion for sword fighting
techniques. By the time he finished his comvelecence at the feild hospital
that the local preist of Shallya had provided the highedst ranking preist
present had seen a rare opertunity in Richard. He offered to pay for
Camrins room and board for the rest of Camrin's life if Richard would serve
him. He began training Richard in the things an Initiate would know except
spells, while he searched the sacred text for something that would allow a
preist of Shallya to own a sword and use it for non-combative things
provided that he had a strong averesion to blood shed (he stop a well
meaning underling from casting cure insanity on Richard just in the nick
if time). If he found this passage then increase Richard give him all of
the skills with question marks after them and the spells listed. Later
since nobody would someone so proficient with a blade of being a spy for
Shallya (they like to know of plans made against them so that they can
avoid a confrontation) he may have sent him to spy school. If you want to
use him in this mode give him all the skills and trappings with an 's'
after them. After Richard prove himself as a spy the priest is planing to
give him a highly disguised amulat of disease resistance and insert him
into the command stucture of Nurgles underlings. If at all possible he 
would also have the skill inmunity to disease just to be on the safe side.
His mother BTW is nobody remarkible and is currently living with her 
husband in the temple of Shallya.
