Freiherr Schwantz von Schwantz

Freiherr Schwantz von Schwantz is the perfect commoner's daydream of the
idiotic aristocrat.  He is incredibly obtuse, as bright as coal, and has a
mind that works like a cement-filled Swiss watch.  He is every
revolutionary's favourite Exhibit A.

Schwartzenatter uses him as cover; nobody would suspect a noble in
Schwantz' company of espionage, or anything other than an incredible
tolerance for idiotic friends.  He also provides a butt for
Schwartzenatter's waspish humour.

Quotable quote:  "You say that we couldn't possibly lose!  Well, we
_could,_ if we wanted to!"
