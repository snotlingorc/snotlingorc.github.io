Udo Schmidt
Human Male
Mercenary Sergeant (ex-Soldier)

M 4 WS 60 BS 55 S 4 T 5 W 11 I 52 A 2 DX 42 LD 45 INT 45 CL 39 WP 42 FEL 39

Skills: Excellent vision, consume alcohol, disarm, dodge blow, gamble,
secret language (battle tongue), street fighter, strike mighty blow, strike
to stun, read/write.

Udo Schmidt is the pragmatic, realistic orderly serving Pfirsich Marie
Wustenfuchs.  His practical approach, he believes, serves his officer well,
balancing her idealistic, gentle view of the world.  Being from the lower
classes, he is less at odds with the realities of the military.  

Udo lives with a dreadful secret---his parents, in Altdorf, are
high-ranking members of a Chaos Cult worshipping the Horned Rat.
He is terrified of Witch Hunters and Templars, fearing that one fine day
he'll be the star of one of their famous barbeques.

He is short (about five feet three--can't think of the metric equivalent,
but twelve inches is one foot, and two and a half centimeters is an inch),
dark-haired, and gardens enthusiastically in between seeing that his
officer's life runs smoothly.
