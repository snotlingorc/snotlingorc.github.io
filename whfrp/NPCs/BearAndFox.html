<h2>-The Bear and Fox  of Kislev-</h2>

<p>
The beastmen came at him from the dark 
shadows of the tall green pines.  Only his sharp
eyes saved him from walking into a spear.  Prince
Gregor had slain three quickly with his skilled strong 
hands, but the other four attempted to corral him in a wide circle.
Recognizing the danger this posed he charged one of the manbeasts,
ducking under its crude thrust and running it through,
instantly withdrawing his weapon to bring it to
bare completely behind him, piercing the other
beastman running to slay him.  His backswing
extinguished whatever life the tainted goat-man
possessed as it's blood sprayed into the sky like
a twisted fountain, catching him on his sword arm.
<p>
An inferno erupted onto his arm where the blood of
the goat-headed thing had landed.  It was sticking to his
skin and burning like some mad bonfire released upon him.  A
scream erupted from his lips as he released Velrinqor
and dwindled to his knees.  The pain was a constant
intense burning that caused his limb to go into spasms.
<p>
The two remaining vile creatures approached him, obviously
content with his pain.  One of them, who had large horns resting
on its dog's head and a pair of slimy brown tentacles
right below its chest, stepped closer and gave what appeared
to be a mocking laugh.  It looked right into his clear dark blue
eyes with its black orbs of its own an said coarsely,
<i>"The bear of Kislev dies today"</i>.  With that, it raised the crude
stone axe to end Gregor's life.
<p>
In that instant, a loud threatening growl echoed throughout
the forest, coming from everywhere at once, yet in no one
place in particular.  The beastman hesistated from its act,
stopping to glance nervously around the area along with its
other companion.  Acting out of instinct, Gregor grabbed
Velrinqor in his other hand and thrust with his last strength
into the wicked thing before him.  The enchanted sword
entered into it with the ease of sliding into its own scabbard,
ripping through twisted flesh and fur to find the heart of the
chaotic creature.
<p>
A figure leapt passed him at the bewildered remaining
beastman, who had just enough wits to parry the oncoming
attack.  The prince watched in astonishment as he recognized
his savior;  Prince Viktor, his younger brother.  A fifteen year old
who looked much more youthful than his age and who lacked his
brute strength and ability with the blade.  Yet here he was fighting a
thing from some horrible nightmare.
<p>
The last beastman did not remain stunned for long, and began
to strike back at Viktor.  The prince dropped his guard,
surprising the mutant who connected eagerly with its
mace into the royal's shoulder.  The cunning Viktor reacted
with percision as the beastman hit, bringing his blade in an
unorthodoxical circle before spearing his foe in the neck, ending
the bloody struggle.
<p>
<i>"....Wha...What are you doing here Viktor?  What wa...ahhh!
What was that sound?"</i>, Gregor asked through the shattering
wall of pain.
<p>
<i>"Why, I just wanted to see what you were sneaking off to.
As for the sound Gregor, you should know your own
battlecry!"</i>, the prince said with a weak smile as he clutched his
shattered collar-bone.  He slowly made his way over to Gregor
and proffered a hand to help his much larger brother up to his feet.
<p>
<i>"You've never made a bear growl like that before, Viktor!"</i>,
was all that Gregor could manage to say.
<p>
The smile grew wider on his brother's devious face.
<i>"Let's just say that I never had enough proper inspiration
before today.  Come, let us get home and face father's wrath.  I'm
sure it will hurt much worse than our current injuries, but one must
be brave, right Gregor?  That's what you're always telling me
anyways...."</i>.
<p>
The two brothers leaned on one another as they left the woods.
Viktor looked back only briefly at the tracks his brother had
overlooked in the confusion.  The tracks of a bear. 
Despite the discomfort, Viktor's smile grew wider still.

<b>Description:</b> Prince Gregor is tall handsome man with a muscular
physique.  He sports a dark black moustache to match his
shoulder-length hair.  He looks very similar to his father, the Tsar,
when the ruler was a youth.  A long blemish runs along the complete
length of his left arm (burns from the acid-blood of a beastman he slew).
<p>
Note: Gregor is left-handed.

<p>
-History-
Prince Gregor, first son of Tsar Radii Bokha and Lady Nastassia
Morustich-Bokha, was born twenty-six winters ago.
Gregor arrived while Tsar Bokha was on a hunting expedition
in which the ruler of Kislev slew a bear of enormous size after
tracking the creature through many miles.  As the Tsar returned
with his trophy he found he had become a father.  A celebration
commenced which lasted a whole week.  During that time
the story of the slain bear coinciding with the birth of Gregor was
taken as a fortunate omen for the first-born prince.  The bear, to
Kislevites, represents not only strength, but endurance, loyalty, and
patience; hence the people of Kislev began to begin to call Gregor
'The Bear' as a sign of affection for the little child.  The skin of the
bear still resides to this day within the royal throne room to see for all
those who come to visit.
<p>
Life for the young royal was strict and his upbringing proved
to be very easy; Gregor proved to be an apt student in all areas
of training.  Only a few events during his adolescence was the prince
a problem, although this was never made public.  These
events usually involved things to be encouraged except that Gregor
took them to the extreme; practicing fencing until he would faint from
lack of food and water, competing in dangerous events with other
nobles, and sometimes challenging his father's edicts
that he felt were wrong (although he never said his father was
wrong, he mainly suggested alternatives to the Tsar to the point of
Radii's tolerance).
<p>
As a young adult Gregor proved to a master warrior,
able to defeat his trainer most of the time in their mock-duels
after his seventeenth birthday.  The older the prince became,
the more independent he was.  Oftentimes he would sneak into
the forest and hunt, alone, with no guards or protectors.  It was
duringone such incident that the prince almost lost his life to a band
of ambushing beastmen.  He gallanty killed five by his own
hand out of the band of seven, yet the fifth proved to be
deadlier in its death.  The dead thing's blood sprayed out,
catching Gregor on his arm, burning it severely.  While the two
remaining beastmen advanced to slay the wounded prince a loud
growl echoed through the woods.  The growl distracted the beastmen
long enough for Gregor to slay one while Prince Viktor emerged from
behind a tree to engage the other.  After a quick but brutal
battle, it was over and the two princes were alive, albiet
both wounded.  Viktor had followed his older brother to discover
where he would sneak off to and was wandering a few hundred
yards away when the beastmen attacked.  Viktor used a
childhood tease, the growl of a bear, to distract the tainted
manthings.  The fox, it seemed, had saved the bear.
<p>
Gregor, within the last six years, has accomplished much.
The prince is a Knight of the White Wolf and has become
an accomplished field commander, as well as an honorary
member of the ranger-knights, the Brotherhood of the Bear.
Add to this intensive training in aristocratic functions, it is very
impressive indeed.  Most natives of Kislev regard Prince
Gregor as the best warrior in the lands and tell in awe stories of his
might.  He has also convinced his father to allocate more
funds to battle the chaotic creatures that hide within the deep
forests around the cities.
<p>
-Personality-
Prince Gregor is destined to become the next Tsar, and this
fact weighs heavily upon him.  He is a man with many burdens
and few vices.  Duty is all he has known, and although he would
never abandon his responsibilities, sometimes he desires to be alone
with his thoughts and not be bothered by all the necessities he
constantly faces.  This makes him moody when he is forced to
make many decisions promptly when he would rather contemplate
for a time.
<p>
The prince, while not jovial, is friendly and has an regal presence.
One of his faults is his temper, which is normally not a problem.
However, when challenged on an issue he believes strongly in he
has been known to raise his deep voice (except to the Tsar, of 
course).
<p>
Gregor is fond of his little brother, and has protective feelings
towards him.  These feelings surface when he sees his brother's
'skulking' episodes.  The elder prince is confused to as what the
source of these negative emotions, but tries to do his best to
cheer Viktor up.  Lately his brother has been harder to reassure,
and this concerns him gravely.

except for his long dark red hair which he wears in a pony-tail
(it hangs down to the middle of his back).  A sly smile and
the raising and lowering of his bushy eyebrows are facets of his
personality that peak out sometimes during the more boring moments
of royal pageantry he is forced to endure from time to time.

<p>
-History-
A year and a half later the Tsar found that he would be a father
again.  Happy with the current affairs he promised a gift to
the people of Kislev on his second child's birthday in remembrance
of the fond wellwishers of his first son's birth.  When the time came
the Tsar was beset by pleas from various groups as to what the
gift should be as Viktor was born into the world.  Radii listened
intently and sifted through the requests with his advisors.
He was beginning to feel foolish for his oath of a gift to the his whole
nation - what could he possibly give to that many people?  Not
another holiday, for it would indicate favor to the lower working classes,
displeasing those whom they worked for.  A work of art or
monument would not please those of the lower class, as it would indicate
favor to those higher up on the social ladder.
<p>
Finally, a represntative from Erengrad arrived and brought with him a
suggestion - pardon a hero to the people for his past crimes and
allow him to retire within the lands he loved so much.  Vastor Felvak,
'The Fox', was an outlaw of wide reknown whose name had
reached Radii's ears many times.  Vastor was a thief of great
reknown who would often steal from the pompus and arrogant,
more to teach a lesson than to gain monetary wealth, usually
giving away most of his ill-gotten goods to those in dire straits.
He had earned the nickname 'The Fox' due to his cunning and
ability to always find a way out of the situation.  The Tsar
himself had some of his ancestral jewelry stolen by none
other than Vastor, and was quick to point out even if he were
to pardon all the Fox's other crimes he would still pay dearly for
the lost treasures that were, no doubt, in some Brettonian noble's
filthy hands.  The represenative suggested it might be possible to
retrieve the items if the pardon were forthcoming.  The Tsar thought
on this for a while, realizing it would be to his advantage to exonerate
the Fox;  this would free a popular legend which would help
fulfill his 'gift' as it were to his people and he would fulfill his own
desires by gaining back his family's precious gems.
<p>
Tsar Radii Brokha summoned the messanger back and agreed to
those terms, to which the messanger brought forth a large silk bag
which was given over to the advisors of the court.  When opened the
royal jewels were discovered to be the contents.  Radii was
amazed at how the represenative had obtained them so fast, to which
the man replied that he had no need to travel for the treasure he had hidden
within the palace.  The man was none other than Vastor Felvak, the
notorious Fox!  Radii was amazed at the audacity of this thief, but
fulfilled his promise (if a little reluctantly).  The rogue made
 a final comment as he left the throne room, saying that young
Viktor should inheirit his title, as he was the only one clever
enough to catch the elusive Fox.  Vastor's story of his pardon
spread throughout all of Kislev and beyond, giving rise to Viktor's
new title.  The bear now had a fox for a brother.
<p>
Viktor's childhood was different from his older brother's.
He never had Gregor's command of weapons, nor the
inclination for other physical activities.  The young prince
did like the more scholary pursuits, and was reknowned for
his light-hearted attitude towards life.  Hardly a day would
go by without Viktor being chastised for not being more
like his brother, yet his demeanor did not change in the slightest.
A problem his instructors worried about was his light build - they
had hoped he would eventually fill out his frame like his brother and
grow stronger, but this wish proved in vain.  The prince, to
this day, has a light physique.
<p>
One day Viktor asked his father if he could study to become
a wizard.  The Tsar grew so furious at his son he began to
berate the young prince in front of the entire court, going
so far as to say that he was deeply ashamed of him.  Viktor
bowed and marched coldly out of the room.  Radii felt that a
royal becoming a wizard would soil the family's honor and  let this
be known to everyone.  Since that day, despite the Tsar's best efforts,
Viktor treats him with a cordial aloofness that borders on ignoring
him totally.
<p>
Since that day the prince began leading a secret life outside of the
palace.  At first he would go into gambling establishments and
make huge bets, not caring the true outcome, what did money
mean to someone who could always get more?  Viktor often
was a winner, as he had a natural talent for playing the odds.
Soon he became tired of this endeavor and looked for a more
challenging ventures.  It came to him in the form of Silus Rencott,
one charlatan from Altdorf.  Silus took the smart young man under his
wing and taught him a different type of magic, one much more subtle.
Viktor had not informed his teacher who he really was, all the charlatan
thought he was some minor noble down on his luck.  After a few months,
when the prince had learned all that he could, he revealed this fact to
Silus (who fainted and could not be revived for an hour).  The royal
appointed Silus his chief advisor, a post which he serves most
eagerly to this day.
<p>
Viktor has a strange habit of dissappearing for long periods of time,
disguised as someone from the lower class.  Many tales have sprung
up around the cities of Kislev of the prince helping those who sought to
aid his false persona, which is true.  The Tsar knows of this,
but says nothing for fear it will drive his son farther away.  The other
members of the aristocraty frown on this activity, yet seldom voice their
opinions outside their manors (one never knows if the Fox is listening).
<p>
-Personality-
Prince Viktor is truly a unique individual, someone who is content
with the simple things in life.  The pleasure of embarrassing a snobby
baron or joy at rewarding those who are willing to help their fellow man.
Very rarely does the prince become angry, and never has he become
violent.  He can defend himself if he must, but has little wish for battle of
any kind.  Recently the prince has become more cynical, even passing
up opportunities for mirth, which is out of character for him.
<p>
Sadly, Viktor often feels inadequate when compared to his older sibling.
There is no hatred between the two, and they both share a genuine
friendship.  It is just that Gregor has always been his father's favorite
(in Viktor's mind anyways), and in some ways the younger prince is in
his shadow.  This causes Prince Viktor to occasionally suffer from
fits of self-doubt and depression, often going on drinking binges that
would make the hardiest of warriors cringe.  A few onlookers have noted
that the prince has adopted a flippant attitude to his own well being,
caring little for his appearance as of late.  Some even go so far as to
think that the royal is contemplating suicide.
<p>
Self-destruction is the farthest thing from Viktor's mind.
  He wants freedom.  What he is actually contemplating is
running away, possibly towards the Empire, and start a new
comfortable life for himself.  Perhaps with the right friends....
<p>
+Role-playing Ideas+
<p>
Prince Viktor decides to run away from his heritage and
travel to the Empire.  Prince Gregor, talking with Silus,
discovers his brother's source of discomfort - him.  Without
consulting his father, Gregor sets out to follow him.  The Tsar is at
a loss as to what to do; both of his sons have vanished without a
word and he is in the dark why.
<p>
The pcs could be a group hired by the Tsar to track down his sons.
Or the pcs could actually meet one of the 'common' looking princes
and befriend him, helping them in their seperate quests (i.e.
hiding/building a new life or searching for the lost prince).
<p>
Another interesting challenge is if the gm actually allowed his
players to play the two princes in a scenario, with any left over
pcs taking the roles of Silus, bodyguards, royal friends, advisors,
etc.  The adventure could be about many different things :
political intrigue (a bastard son of the Tsar shows up to upsurp
their posistions), a threat to the monarchy, an ambassador role, etc.
