Notes on herb descriptions
--------------------------
Price: Two cost are given for one dose of each herb. The first is the
        cost in season, and the second is the cost out of season.
Method of Application: There are four methods of application;
        Brew: the herb must be stood in boiling water for a few minutes and
                then drunk.
        Ingest: the herb must be eaten.
        Inhale: the herb must be immersed in boiling water for a few minutes
                and the fumes inhaled.
        Smear: the herb is made into an ointment or poultice which is applied
                to the injured part.
Preparation: This is the time needed to dry and otherwise prepare the herb so
        it can be used. No special equipment (other than a pestle and mortar)
        or facilities are required. Once prepared, it will remain effective
        for a period equal to the preparation time. After that there is a
        10% cumulative chance per week that the herb loses its efficency.
Dosage: This is the minimum time which must elapse before a second dose may
        be administred. Failure to observe this requirement means that
        a subsequent dose has no effect, and a period of twice this length
        must elapse before another dose will have any effect.
        This effect is cumulative.
Skills: Any skills listed here must be possessed by the character
        administering the herb, in addition to Herb Lore or Identify Plant.
Tests:  Lists any test to be made by the administering character for the herb
        to be effective.

 Effects: The Black Hove is a magickally created plant, all magic using
  creatures are immediately aware of any 'Hoves in their vicinity. Animals
  shun it for some unexplained reason. This plant was created by one of
  the high priests of the Pleasure Cult before it was outlawed in Ulthuan.
  He fled to the Old World, but was hunted down and summarily killed.
  Before his death he managed to plant his pet project in the marsh around
  Marienburg. It has since thrived and expanded.
  If drunk by magick creatures it will release a sudden burst of pent up
  magick energy equal to the casters BMP (this is how much of it he "soaks" 
  up). With this plant the MP's can go above the casters maximum. However
  there are darker sides to this plant, and that is that it can be addictive,
  as well as its side effects. One to three hours after drinking this brew
  the person will at first become confused, then he will experience a high,
  which lasts for about 3 hours, then the depressions begin. ALL percentage
  characteristics are reduced by 15%. In its beginning the plants effect
  didn't have the time lag between the release of energy and the high,
  but as times past, the plant changed slightly.

Cause and Effect
----------------
Some herbs need to be combined with other herbs to have an effect at all,
while others should be kept as far away as possible from other herbs.

When a person has been drugged by a herb that causes e.g. drowsiness, 
another herb can be administered, to counter effect the first. I would
not advise this, but it can be used as a last resort. Two herbs mixed 
can cause varied side effects, They could become a super- stimulant 
(the character is high for the next 24 hours), or the opposite; fall 
into a coma. The GM should find the ideal (for the campaign) between
these two extremes.

When attempting to counter the effect of one herb with another, roll on the
table below to see what sort of effect is attained.

Table of effect
---------------
01-20 Super-Stimulant
21-40 Mildly stimulating
41-60 Cancellation
61-80 Drowsiness
81-00 Comatose
