Subject: [WFRP:1158] Energy Criticals

My gaming group and I wanted a little more pizazz when our PCs died or
killed others with Energy spells (most likely fireball or lightning bolt
spells).  To that end, we came up with a set of crit tables similar to those
for the body locations.  However, since the energy spells don't hit just one
location, there is no need to worry about that.  Use this table just like
you would the others : roll on the percentage table for the seriousness of
the critical, read the resulting effect off of this table.  We usually just
use it as a guide for how serious the damage is, it gets rather boring to
read the same thing over and over.

As far as the design of the table is concerned, we tried to construct it
similarly to the others - 1-3 are not too serious, 14-16 are death, the
others vary in severity.

Anyway, hope you all like it, and can use it.

Energy Criticals
1 - His breath taken away by the intense enegies involved in the spell, the
victim may only parry next round.
2 - Acrid, thick smoke rising from clothing and the surroundings chokes the
victim, no further actions this round or the next.
3 - The intense heat scorches hands. Metal objects are dropped and become
cherry red, non-magical wooden objects are charred, magical wood saves at
1-4 on d6, otherwise it is also destroyed. Opponent may make no actions for
the remainder of this and the following round.
4 - The victims hair is briskly aflame; they may take no other actions for
following rounds, until hair is extinguished.  Helmetted/hairless opponents
are incapacitated for one round only.
5 - The force of the spell blasts the victim back 2d6 yards, and they are
stunned and may do nothing at all for the next d4 rounds.
6 - The victim's clothing/fur bursts into flames (whoof!!); they will d4
W/rd., and are prone while trying to put it out.
7 - Searing energy courses across the victim's skin, burning it severely.
Victim is stunned for d4 rounds, and M and I are halved until victim
receives medical attention.
8 - The burns on the victim's body are extremely serious (as 7, above). They
will be stunned for 2d4 rounds, M & I are halved, and they will lose 1 W/rd.
until medical attention is received.
9 - The energy of the spell has seared away tissue over most of the victim's
body. They are stunned for 2d4 rounds, M & I are halved, and they lose 1
W/rd.  In addition, scarring reduces Fel by half, permanently.
10 - The victim is concussed and burned, and is in shock; they are prone,
unconscious, and must pass a T test or lose d4 W/rd.
11 - The victim is in shock from the concussion and burns (as 10, above). In
addition, they must pass another T test every round until medical attention
is received, or permanently lose 10%/1 from each characteristic.
12 - The force of the spell has burned away 90% of the victim's skin,
exposing vital organs. The roasted victim is prone, unconscious, loses 10%/1
from each characteristic, and will die in d10 rounds unless medical
attention is received.
13 - The victim is so horribly burned that, upon unlikely recovery, scarring
reduces all characteristics by half; until medical attention is received,
victim is prone and receives d6 W/rd.
14 - Victim and all that is worn erupt in a ball of flame. The victim runs
randomly from the combat, and continues burning until death in d4 rounds.
15 - Victim explodes in a brilliant pyrotechnical display - OOOHHH!!
AAAHHH!!!!
16 - Victim bursts into flames, and burns instantly and intensely, leaving
only bits of teeth and bone in a pile of ash.
