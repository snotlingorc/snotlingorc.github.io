I didn't have the rule book on me. Change that to the difference between a
greater an lesser deamon then (Assuming lesser deamons cause fear.).

perhaps a combination of them both

Chance of causing terror:
    Lesser deamon:  70%-cool
    Greater deamon: 90%-cool 

effects:
   Fail by 1%-5%   Stunned by Shear disbelief - defend only
   Fail by 6%-10%  Flees in fear- gains a few insanity points
   Fail by 11%-15% Curls up into ball and bables - counts prone- insanity
                   gain

 All in the gms realm of roleplaying. As long as the charcters can
sufficiently justify it. You'd have to take into consideration the amount of
the cool advances that they get just for studying deamons and such though.
