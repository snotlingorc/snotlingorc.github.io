Subject: WFRP: Starting resources

In my campaigns I do not give the characters the standard equipment 
bundles. I give then the cash equivilent to buy what they want.
This also gives the scope for a lot of fun when they realise they 
don't have the equipment they need!
player - I  lower my rope and climb down the cliff!
GM - What rope and grapple? Hahahahaha!!
player - I take a drink from my canteen!
GM - What canteen?
I think this option is more realistic as the preparations are left to 
their discretion.

Starting Resources as follows:
                                     ACADEMIC - 33GC 12/ + 3D6GC
                                     RANGER - 55GC 17/ + 3D6GC
                                     ROGUE - 22GC 2/ + 3D6GC
                                     WARRIOR - 50GC 2/ + 3D6GC
