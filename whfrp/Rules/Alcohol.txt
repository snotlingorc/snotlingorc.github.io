Alcohol is treated as a deleriant poison, though there doesn't seem to be
any mention of that in the rulebook. Maybe it's in TEW. I don't have my
copy with me here. Anybody else know?

The WP test only really comes into play when a character has the Alcoholism
disorder. When a character with that disorder has the opportunity to drink,
he/she has to make a test to fight off the temptation.Consume Alcohol skill
gives a penalty to the WP test because the character *knows* he/she can
handle another drink, and is therefore overconfident and not afraid of the
effects of giving in to temptation.
