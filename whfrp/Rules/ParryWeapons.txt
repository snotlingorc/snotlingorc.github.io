Subject: WFRP: Parry: Weapons Table


I've been thinking about the parrying rules and finally I've tried 
something that I think is good enough:

The table is an addition to the one in WFRP. I hope you like it.

Hand Weapon	-	-	-	-		-
Knife/Dagger	+10	-	-2	-20		-20
Spear		+10/+20	+10	-	-		-

And now some explications

"to parry" means the difficult that your opponent has when trying to
parry your blow.
"parrying" means the difficult to parry with your weapon

knife/Dagger: It's difficult to parry a Dagger but it's difficult to 
parry with it as well. So, a knife Vs. knife combat is quite mortal ideed.
  
Improvised: Easy to see it coming, difficult to parry with (you're 
improvising)

Bastard: No modifications if you use it with two hands (I mean 2 hands 
free, not the 2 hands at the same time)

2-handed: Clumsy and difficult to move it quickly enough to parry.

Quarter staff: You can catch it everywhere, so it's fast and big.

Flail and 2-h Flail: No handle, no easy parry. You have to hit opponent 
weapon in order to parry.

Buckler: The perfect weapon to parry with, as a shield is, but you still 
only save 1d6 wounds (instead all damage using shield).

L-h Dagger: It's small, but made to parry. I suggest that when used with 
a sword, get a free parry (because you can use it at the same time you 
attack)

Lance: Parry with a Lance?? You're joking

Net: You have to tangle the weapon in order to parry.

Well, that's it. I wait for suggestions, commentaries (good if possible), 
or whatever you want.

Thanks.
