Subject: WFRP: Pikes etc revisted

Regarding Pikes:
----------------
A pike is essentially a very long spear, usually 10-12 ft long, but 
ranging up to 20ft (the longer ones being used in tight unit 
formations). These rules are for a standard Pike 10-12ft long.
Weapon:Pike  Init:+20/+30   To Hit:-10   Dam:-   Parry:-10
Notes:The Pike user receives a +20 Init. bonus during the first round of 
combat and during subsequent rounds if they are winning. If their 
opponenet is mounted, they receive a +30 Init bonus during the first 
round of combat and subseqeunt rounds if winning. 

The To Hit penalty is used for all attacks due to the length of the 
weapon.

Due to the pikes length, an opponent cannot attack the pike user unless
the pike user misses an attack, the attacker beats the pike user with 
Init.(remember the pike user gets a +20/+30 bonus), or the opponent 
successfully dodges or parries and then makes a successful Init. 
roll.

On the downside, a pike is useless once the opponent bypasses the 
point and closes in.

Halberds:
---------
The existing rules for halberds are fine but neglect the fact that 
many had hooks to dismount riders.

Rules for hook use:
Against mounted opponents roll to hit at -10 penalty, but the attack 
does no damage. The halberd user must then roll Str to hold the 
weapon fast. If successful the mounted opponent must roll Ride (not 
Str) in order to remain mounted. If the mounted character is 
galloping/charging both rolls are made at -10.

Against foot opponents use the above rule but the opponent makes a 
Str test to remain standing.
