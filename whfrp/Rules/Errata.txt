Subject: WFRP: Official Errata from WD #92 part 1 (Long)

Ok, as promised, here is the errata from WD #92 (not #93 as I thought 
earlier). It's a bit longish, but if I can type it, you can read it ;-)
I'll skip the intro bit and go straight to the bone:

p15	Dwarfs: Add under Psychology:
	Subject to animosity against elves.

p19	Outrider Advace Scheme: Add +1 S

p24	Druid: add at end of text:
	Only Humans may become Druids.

p28	Herbalist: add `Physician's Student' under Career Exits 
	(also on p346)

p29	Initiate: delete +10 Int, add +10 Fel

p32	Outlaw: add following as first line of text:
	Outlaws are people who are

p43	Wizard's Apprentice:
	Change Magic Points to 2D4 and 1D4. Add +10 Int and +10 WP to advance
	scheme.	

p45	Skill List: 105 should read Sense Magical Alarm, renumber the rest
	accordingly.

p51	Fleet footed: delete last sentence, add: 'They add 1 to their M 
	score.'
 
p53	Manufacture Drugs: change Cure Illness to Cure Disease.

p56	Insert between Seduction and Set Trap:

Sense Magical Alarm. Characters with this skill are able to sense when an 
object or area is protected by the Petty Magic Spell Magic Alarm. A 
successful Int test is necessary to sense the alarm, and the character 
must be within 2 yards of protected area to detect the spell. Note that 
this skill does not permit characters to disarm the Magic Alarm.

p59	Clem's charcater sheet: running rate should be 64 yards.

p75	Parties & Groups: delere  the numbers at the end.

p75	Armour & Encumbrance: change `Toughness x 10' to 
	`(Strength + Toughness) x 100'.

p81	Manufacturing Poisons: replace the paragraph `Find Materials' as 
	follows:

Find Materials: - Ingredients for poisons are generally rare and 
difficult to find, and you may decide that characters may only obtain 
them at certain places (for example, where it is stated in a published 
adventure that ingredients for poisons are available). Alternatively, 
they might be purchased from a suitable source, such as a NPC Pharmacist 
or Alchemist - in this event, most poisons will require D4+1 ingredients, 
which are all Rare, each costin 3D10 shilling per dose. Note that openly 
buying ingredients for poisons is likely to arouse suspicion.

p83	Gaining Insanity Points:

	Critical Hits: change `is forced to roll on the Critical Hits Table'
	to `takes a Critical Hit'.

	Terror: change `D6' to `1'.

p97	Druidic Priest: add at end `Only Humans may become Druidic Priests'.

p98	Free Lance: change +2 I to +20 I

p106	Torturer: replace `Specialist Wepaon - Whip' with
	`Specialist Wepaon - Flail Weapons'.

p118	COmbat Procedure: swap stages 2 and 3.

p118	Parrying: amend paragraph 3 to read:

Weapons suitable for parrying are:

One- and two-handed swords, maces and axes, shields, spears, staves, 
flails (with handle).

All parrying-wepaons - bucklers, sword-breakers, left-handdaggers, etc.

p120	Wepaons: add aftr Fist Weapon:

Whip: The whip is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled 
character, and arguably even more dangerous in the hands of an unskilled 
character. While it does not cause a great amount of danage, it can 
entangle a target on a successful hit. Only a single creature may be hit, 
and the target must make a successful Initiative test or become 
entangled. Entangled creatures counts as prone targets fr further hits, 
and may not attack, although they may attempt a dexterity test each round 
in order to free themselves. Range is 5 yards.

p120	Weapon Modifiers: amend the table to read:

Weapon		Initiative	To Hit	Damage	Parry

Knife/Dagger	  +10		  -	  -2	 -20

p121	Body Areas & Armour:

	Insert at end of paragraph 3: `At the GM's option, a character may
	suffer a -10 penalty to I when doing so.'

	Add after paragraph 5: `A character can wear plate arm bracers over
	a sleeved mail shirt or coat, or over mail arm bracers - which gives 
	two armour points on the legs. At the GM's option, a character may 
	suffer a -10 penalty to I when doing so.'

*** Note: there is a misprint in the Errata: plate arm bracers should 
naturally confer 2 points of armour on the arms, not the legs. ***
