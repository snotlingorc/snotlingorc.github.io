COLOR MAGIC, COLOR COLLEGES, AND WFRP SORCERY
((The following is an extract from the rough draft of REALMS OF SORCERY,
presenting background and rules adapting the idea of color magic (first
detailed in White Dwarf 113 & 114 and implemented in current Warhammer
Fantasy Battle rules) to sorcery for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.))

The Colleges Arcane and the Old Secret Societies:  In earlier periods of cult
persecution of sorcery the practices and traditions of sorcery were guarded
and passed on in the Old World by various secret societies. Now that sorcery
is sanctioned by the sovereigns, many former secret societies have been
assimilated into the guild and academy system as the Colleges Arcane (also
known as "color colleges"). The Colleges Arcane preserve the ancient secret
society practices and traditions in fraternal organizations within the
academy and guild system. 
   In large Guildhalls all of the different colleges are often represented in
the staff and students, but small study centers and guild chapters might be
comprised of members of only one ot two color colleges.

The following list indicates the formal (and informal) titles of the
best-known Colleges Arcane, with a brief description of their guiding
principles.

   Aquilia Aureus (Golden Wizards): Though asserting a dedication to Perfect
Reason and Honor, Gold Wizards have a popular reputation for mercenary greed
and opportunistic ethics. Favored by War Wizards and Necromancers.
    Turris Lumen ( Light Wizards): Preserves traditional values of ancient
Hedgewizardry -- aid the poor, protect the weak, scorn and sting the rich and
powerful. Persecuted by the authorities, honored by peasants and lower
classes. Favored by Illusionists.
   Triskele Triplex (Jade Wizards): Specializes in the nature-oriented
magicks of the rural countryside and wilderness. Favored by Elementalists.
   Carpe Vita (Amethyst Wizards): Playful, immoderate, and self-indulgent,
regarding magick as a toy for art and amusement. Favored by War Wizards and
Daemonologists.
   Espada de la Guardiana (Grey Wizards): Self-appointed itinerent champions
of Justice. Typically War Wizards, often military mercenaries and
soldiers-of-fortune, solitary or in the company of other mercenary warriors,
sometimes cynical, sometimes earnest in pursuit of Justice. Also associated
with Necromancy.
   Cardo Artis (Bright Wizards): Honors the pursuit of Magickal Knowledge,
with little concern for the fates or fortunes of society. Associated with
indiscriminant use of battlefield magicks. Favored by War Wizards and
Daemonologists.
   Sagittarius Arcanus (Amber Wizards): Dedicated to improving the reputation
of sorcery through good works in the community and for the state. Diplomatic,
pragmatic, eager in service of merchant interests, new nobility, and
military. Favored by Elementalists.
   Nuntius Caelestis (Celestial Wizards): Blend astrological mysticism with
intellectual, elitist pretensions. Haven for hyper-intelligent, talented
crackpots. Favored by Illusionists.
   Annulus Mirabilis (Wizards of The Great Wheel): Modern college, vague and
inoffensive, primarily social in nature.
   Oculus Divinus (Rainbow Wizards): Modern college, vague and inoffensive,
primarily social in nature.
   Aranei Tenebrarum (Dark Wizards): This secret society is suppressed by the
Guild and outlawed by the State. Though no Guild wizard would admit to
membership in this college, it remains an open secret among practitioners in
criminal subcultures and certain aristocratic factions.

Other Sorcerous Secret Societies: These societies have remained secret for
various reasons, typically because their practices and traditions are
outlawed or abhorent.
   The Cup and Serpent: An ancient alchemist's society, masters of poisons and appalling potions
   Dead Man's Taper: A necromantic society of Pharonic origin (symbol is a 
candle made from a dead man's hand, with wicks at the tips of the thumb and 
fingers like a candelabra).
   Spines of the Thistle: Ancient and beneficent secret order of adventuring
scholars. Suspicious of the current climate of tolerance, they remain a
secret order in isolation. The sign of the thistle in a remote ruin or on a
strange artifact means that the Thistle has gone before and found no harm.
(Symbol is purple thistle blossom at the top of a stalk covered with sharp
spines.)


BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP IN COLLEGES ARCANE (COLOR COLLEGES)
The Colleges Arcane share exclusive trade secrets with their members which
provide two main benefits for Sorceror characters:
   1. Each college conserves special knowledge which aids in learning and
mastering certain spells and rituals. Because of this special knowledge,
these spells and rituals are easier to learn for college members. (half ep
cost to learn spells and castings in the province of the color college)
   2. Each college conserves secret techniques for sensing and shaping flux
energies. When flux is at a low ebb, these techniques permit sorcerors to
make most effective use of weak flux to cast certain spells and rituals. When
flux is abundant, these techniques permit sorcerors exceptional economies in
expenditure of personal magic power. (When flux is weak, members cast spells
and rituals from their own colleges at normal cost while other sorcerors pay
double magic points. When flux is strong, members cast spells and rituals at
half normal magic points cost, while other sorcerors pay normal costs.)
   NOTE ON FLUX: In Fantasy Battle, the winds of magic shift, limiting the
types of magic that can be cast at any given momen
t. I like the flavor of this, though I don't want it to play a significant
role in WFRP melee. Two schemes suggest themselves:
   1. Roll for flux at regular intervals (for example, each melee round, or
at the beginning of each melee).
   2. Flux is a function of time, place, and circumstance (i.e., a
GM-moderated element of the setting).

SAMPLE SPELL AND RITUAL LIST
The following list indicates the Color College associated with each spell and
casting for the academies of War Wizards and Daemonologists.
    Some spells are also noted as DARK; such spells and castings are the
specialties of Dark Wizards. Dark spells are officially proscribed by the
Guild and outlawed by the State; however, by Imperial decree, these spells
are taught and practiced by the academies under the strict supervision of the
Guilds. Dark spells and castings rely on dangerous manipulations of the Void
(i.e., Chaos), and risk permanent damage to the mind, spirit, and body of the
caster.
