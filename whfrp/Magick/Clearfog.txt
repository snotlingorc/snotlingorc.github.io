Fellow Snotlings,

     Attached below is a spell I devised for the Ulrician priest in my old
WFRP campaign.  While the material below should be regarded as [copyright
1993--Anthony Ragan], please feel free to use it in your home games.  I'd
also be grateful for any comments and critiques y'all might have.  The spell
is in the format of Ken's Sorcerous/Divine Magic rules.  BMP= "base magic
points," which refers to the number of MP's a character has when fully rested
and ready.

CLEAR THE FOG OF BATTLE

Level 1 Prayer

Restrictions:  Priests of Ulric only

Range:  BMP yards radius, centred on the invoking priest

Cost:  2MP to invoke, +1MP per round after the first

Duration:  Variable

Save:  None

Explanation:   Once invoked, the priest can see clearly out to BMP radius
through anything that obscures his vision, other than solid objects.  In
other words, the priest may see through fog, mist, rain, darkness, smoke,
coloured vapours, falling snow, and like circumstances.  However, everything
beyond the radius of the prayer is completely obscured.

Note:   This does not enable a priest to see through solid matter (e.g.,
boulders, armour, wooden walls, etc.).  This is not a prayer of Transparent
Vision.  However, if the invoker is completely immersed in a liquid, he may
use this prayer to see out to BMP radius.

Variations:     A 3rd-level variation, at double the MP cost, allows the priest
to see even if he has lost sight in his eyes or had his eyes destroyed or
removed.
