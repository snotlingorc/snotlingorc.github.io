New Spells

Shadow Cloak

Spell Level : P
Magic Points : 1
Range : Personal
Duration : 1 hour
Ingredients : a piece of tinted glass

The caster holds the glass to his forehead to cast the spell.  As he
does so a black ether floods out over his body merging him into the
darkness.  In daylight the caster wil appear to be standing in the
shade.  In twilight the caster fades to absolute blackness.

This spell is used to lessen the chance of being spotted at night or
when hiding.   Obviously, if cast in broad daylight people might
suspect a black shadow in the middle of the road.


Eye Of Cat

Spell Level : P
Magic Points : 2
Range : 48 yards
Duration : 1 minute
Ingredients : two, small, glass balls

The two glass balls are held in the casters hand and as the spell is
cast glow an eerie green colour losing all material presence.  Slowly
they form a pair of cat's eyes that hover in front of the mage.

This spell allows the caster to see out of a pair of magical cat's
eyes.  The eyes can be guided up to 48 yards away from the caster.
They may be guided through walls or other obstructions if a succesfuly
WP test is made.  The eyes cannot be guided into magical zones, across
magical boundaries or over water.  Only vision is achieved.  Eye
movement rate = 10.
