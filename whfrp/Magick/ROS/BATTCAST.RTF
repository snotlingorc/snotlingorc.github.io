\tab Rationale: Caster imposes a short imperative compulsion in the victim\rquote s conscious mind.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: This is a shallow mental compulsion, not subtly woven into victim\rquote s deeper thoughts and impulses, and not rationalized for the victim, thus easily detected as mental tampering and resisted.\par 
\tab Caster slips a six-syllable command into the victim\rquote s mind, in a language the victim understands.\par 
\tab \bullet  In the first round the victim unquestioningly treats the command as if it were his own thought, and does what it tells him to do.\par 
\tab \bullet  In subsequent rounds, the victim may consider the command. If the command seems like a perfectly normal thou
ght for him to have, he may continue doing what it tells him to do, without trying to resist. Unsuspecting victims are less likely to resist than victims familiar with magickal compulsion, and anticipating such tampering.\par 
\tab If the victim doubts the wisdom of the command, he may test to resist each round. PCs, being adventurers and naturally cautious and suspicious, often deserve a test to resist this spell. A successful WP test ends the spell effects.\par 
\tab Victims commanded to injure themselves or companions, or
 to damage or abandon prized possessions, are most likely to test to resist. Victims unaware of the presence of enemies, and dim-witted humanoids like orcs and goblins, are least likely to test to resist.\par 
\tab When in doubt, test against the victim\rquote s Intelligence, with appropriate modifiers reflecting the nature of the command, as a guide to whether the victim is suspicious of the command and deserves to test to resist.\par

Magick Effects: The caster enters a light trance, during which he can detect magick as with the Petty spell. (See page ??.) While in this trance he is blind to the Material Realm, though his other senses are not affected, and he may move and act as a blin

\tab Rationale: The victim is convinced that now would be a good time to catch up on sleep.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: For 3 rounds the subject is drowsy, but awake. All Initiative, WS, BS, skill, characteristic, and standard tests receive a -40 penalty.\par 
\tab At the end of the third round of effect, the subject may test vs. WP to resist at the GM\rquote 
s discretion. If the test is passed, no further effect. If the test is failed, subject falls into a deep, magickal sleep, and cannot be roused by normal means (e.g., 
shaking, loud noises, etc.). Subject awakens if he receives a wound (or if violently affected in some other manner, at GM discretion).\par 
\tab If cast when a victim would not normally fall asleep (i.e., while in combat, in conversatio
n, or other vigorous activity), the victim may resist the suggestion. If cast when a victim plausibly might fall asleep (i.e., on watch, alone in a comfortable chair, while exhausted), the victim usually does not resist. Affects only creatures with minds s
imilar in nature and complexity to that of the caster. Most man-sized intelligent humanoids are affected normally. Other animals, monstrous creatures, magickal beings, giants, etc. are generally not affected.\par

\tab Rationale: The caster summons and is borne by a horde of air elemental nodes. The caster commands and coordinates the movement of the nodes instinctively through a mental link between his Spirit and the nodes.\par 
\tab 
Magick Effects: The caster is carried up to 48 yards in any direction. Flight may be sustained for additional rounds by expending 3 MP per round, but no action other than flight is permitted during these rounds. Caster may also tow and guide two Levitated
 characters; hands of Flying caster and Levitated character(s) must be securely clasped.\par 
\tab The caster may carry up to half his normal, non-penalty encumbrance while in flight (see \ldblquote Armor and Encumbrance\rdblquote , {\ul WFRP}, page 75). Attempts to carry more may end in disaster. \par 
\tab Straight-line or gentle curve maneuvers are fairly simple. Fancy flying requires skill and dexterity, and the GM may assess one or more Initiative tests, according to the complexity of the proposed maneuvers. \par 
\tab Flying takes concentration. Fliers cannot use magickal devices, or drop bombs, or relay intelligence reports; they are too busy keeping the air nodes under control and on course.\par 
\tab Fliers carrying more than half their normal encumb
rance may be required to make Initiative tests at -50 penalties or more, according to the weight and bulk of the encumbrance. Failed testers may be cheerfully and colorfully killed using the Falling rules ({\ul WFRP}
, page 75). At his discretion, the GM may rule more modest penalties for very simple, very short, very desperate flights.{\*\bkmkstart LINK28}\par

\tab Rationale: Caster allows his mind to slip into sympathy with the flow of the victim\rquote 
s thoughts. By resting gently on the surface of the thoughts, and not attempting to steer the thoughts or tamper with them, the caster avoids announcing his presence to the victim.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The caster is aware of the thoughts and impressions of the victim\rquote s conscious mind for the duration of the spell. If the victim is speaking, the caster will know the victim\rquote s words a
s he speaks. The caster will also know whether the victim\rquote 
s spoken words are thought by the victim to be true or false, or whether the victim is consciously trying to conceal or misrepresent the truth. If the victim is not speaking, the caster will know the nature of the victim\rquote 
s conscious thoughts in the form of a stream of more-or-less coherent phrases. \par 
\tab Victims aware of this probing caster may fool the caster (\ldblquote test to resist\rdblquote ), as one may fool a lie detector machine, by passing an Intelligence test, an
d if successful may either feed the caster false information, or resist the spell entirely, at the victim's option.  If the resistance roll is fumbled, the caster will know the victim was attempting to resist.\par

\tab The subject may {\b choose} to test vs. WP to resist; if the test is successful, the spell has no effect.\par

\tab The caster places reversed castings of spells and rituals into the thaumaturgic triangle. The reversed spell and ritual effects are then stored in the t
riangle until the area of effect is contacted by a corresponding magickal effect. This contact triggers a discharge of the reverse magick effect, which cancels the incoming magickal effect.\par 
\tab Creating a thaumaturgic triangle requires three steps:\par 
\tab 1. inscribing the form pattern,\par 
\tab 2. inscribing the rune inscriptions upon the pattern,\par 
\tab 3. casting the form ritual, when all reversed spells and rituals are stored in the form; the form is activated by the completion of the ritual\par 
\tab Triangles may be inscribed with r
unes of certain spells and rituals. The caster may charge the triangle with the reverse castings of any spells and rituals as he knows, and the circle will retain the canceling spell or ritual effects, discharging them only when the corresponding magick ef
fect contacts the triangle\rquote s area of effect.\par 
\tab Each reversed casting charged into a triangle will cancel the effects of one casting. Reversed castings will only cancel the effects of the standard casting of their own spell or ritual (i.e., a reverse casting
 of Deepsleep will cancel a casting of Deepsleep, but not a casting of any other spell or ritual).\par

{\*\bkmkend LINK116}\par 
\tab Rationale: The subject or object is borne up by a horde of air elemental nodes, becoming effectively as buoyant and weightless as a soap bubble.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The subject or object may be thrown or shoved about as far as a soap bubble; that is, not very far. However, it may towed or pushed easily.\par 
\tab The subject or object must be no greater in dimensions or weight than a normal human with
 clothing and light trappings. No armor or shields may be borne; no more than two hand weapons or one large weapon may be borne. The air nodes will simply refuse to lift any subject or object heavier or larger than the spellcaster.\par 
\tab 
One or two characters affected by this spell may link hands with a spellcaster affected by the Flight Minor or Flight Major spells and may be towed and guided through the air as in flight. If the spellcaster crashes, so do the towed characters, who suffer
 damage from falling as does the crashing spellcaster. (See the {\i flight minor} spell). One or two man-sized cargoes may also be towed and guided by the spellcaster.\par 
\tab Characters or cargoes separated from the guiding spellcaster float aimlessly for the duration of the {\i levitate}
 spell, then crash to the ground and take falling damage. The spellcaster cannot aim them like bombs; they crash to the ground at the GM's convenience.\par 
\tab Move is reduced to 0, and WS, BS, and Init are reduced to 5 for characters affected by a Levitate spell.\par 
\tab Flying spellcasters who successfully grapple (see {\ul WFRP}
, page 119) a Levitated opponent may drag him into the air, intending to abandon the victim there to plunge to his doom when the Levitate effect ends. However, if the opponent permitted to attempt to cling to the flying spellcaster so that both crash to th

Area of Effect: Caster\par 
Reagents: Earth and water sublimates*, preserved spider tissues\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: Earth nodes stick to the caster\rquote s hands and feet, and temporarily bond to surfaces he attempts to climb. Water nodes deflect any moisture which may be present.\par 
\tab 
Magick Effects: The caster effectively gains the Scale Sheer Surface skill for the duration, and can climb any surface at a Cautious movement rate; natural earth surfaces (such as a cliff) can be climbed at a Standard movement rate. Those who already have
 the Scale Sheer Surface skill can move at half again this rate. Additionally, the caster may climb along normally difficult or impossible surfaces, such as a ceiling, {\b if} all four limbs are used for movement.\par 
\tab The combination of the \ldblquote stickiness\rdblquote  and the moisture repellent allows the caster to move along most sorts of slippery ground without making Risk tests. This \ldblquote stickiness\rdblquote 
 allows the user a +5% to his resistance test vs. the petty spell {\i knock down} and similar magickal effects. Other bonuses may be applied at the GM\rquote s discretion.\par 
\tab Notes: The caster may cast other spells without ending the spell duration, but note that it is typically impossible to do so while hanging from a cliff face.\par 
\tab Because the water nodes are repelling moisture on surfaces the caster moves along, his progress may be reflected in dry hand- or footprints the caster leaves behind\par

 other attacks not perceived by the caster. Can be used in conjunction with a physical weapon parry. \par 
\tab Against enchanted weapons, the SpiritShield is especially effective, reducing damage by 1 point {\b and} dissip

\tab Rationale: A horde of air elemental nodes is summoned and controlled to form a buffeting wind.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: A lateral column of wind is created 6 yards wide, extending BMP yards from caster.\par 
\tab \bullet  Missile fire in the area of effect is at a -50 penalty to BS.\par 
\tab \bullet  Victims are staggered in the first round, must fight to maintain balance, and may perform no other actions.\par

\tab Magick Effects: One front or side attack per round may be automatically parried, reducing damage by 1d6+3 points.\par 
\tab While affected by this spell, the caster may not both cast a spell or ritual and parry a blow with his Aethyrward in the same round.\par 
\tab Against enchanted weapons, the Aethyrward is especially effective, reducing damage by 1d6+3 points {\b and} dissipating the arcane energies of the enchanted weapon, negating any magickal effects associated with the artifact (for that strike only).
\par 
\tab The Aethyrward itself takes the form of an intensifying of the Spirit body along the surface of the caster\rquote

Rationale: A section of the boundary between mundane space and the Void is separated from its matrix and temporarily manifested in the Material Realm. The substance of the boundary manifests as a coherent sheet of adhesive, fibrous, semi-solid material ca
lled plasm.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: A one foot thick sheet of plasm 4 yards by 4 yards appears within range of the caster. The caster may or
ient the sheet at any angle relative to his position. The sheet of plasm remains suspended as it appears until the magick effect ends. A being in contact with the adhesive plasm must test vs. STR x 5 to pull free of the plasm sheet. A being may move throug
h the plasm sheet at Standard Rate if he tests vs. STR x 5; if he fails, he fails to penetrate the plasm, and is trapped at the point of first contact for the remainder of the round. Movement through the plasm sheet does not damage the sheet itself.\par 
\tab The s
ubstance of a sheet of manifested plasm is similar to wads of freshly chewed bubble gum reinforced by numerous strands of elastic dental floss. The surface is extremely sticky, adhering to anything that comes into contact with it. A plasm sheet obscures vi
sion, and blocks arrows, bolts, sling stones, and other small missiles. The sheet itself cannot be moved by physical force; it is firmly rooted in the Void. The substance can be parted or pressed through by vigorous actions, but it closes up immediately af
terward.\par

\par 
\tab Rationale: A Chaos pinhole opens at the tip of the caster\rquote s focus. From the pinhole a mass of minute vortices form a two-yard-diameter sphere of destruction.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The caster opens a temporary pinhole through the void membrane into the Void. Through this pinhole a number of minute vo
rtices are everted from the Chaos Realm into the Material Realm, and from the Material Realm into the Chaos Realm. Contact between these vortices and mundane matter results in destructive disordering of the mundane matter.\par 
\tab In the first round the wormhole forms at the tip of the caster\rquote 
s focus, and may be directed to move 2d6 yards in a direction chosen by the caster. In subsequent rounds the wormhole moves 1d6 yds in a random direction (roll 1d12), damaging anything it touches along its path.\par 
\tab Any object, surface, or being that contacts the sphere of destruction receives 3d6 points of damage, regardless of armor, but reduced by Toughness.\par 
\tab 
Note: Matter contacted by one of the writhing tendril-like vortices surrounding the Chaos pinholes is abruptly disorganized, sometimes causing the matter to explode into its component substances, liquids, and gases, sometimes causing solid matter to lique
fy and swirl like boiling porridge, sometimes causing the matter to disappear into the pinhole. The pinhole is accompani
ed by a loud, piercing, squealing noise caused by the violent flow of matter from the mundane world into Chaos, and the sharp sizzling as the vortices destroy bits of mundane matter.\par 
\tab 
The flux of mundane matter into Chaos through the pinhole causes ossification of Chaos, a condition as greatly dreaded by beings of Chaos as the destructive effects of Chaos are to the mundane world. This effect prevents Chaos beings from using the pinhol
e as a conduit to our plane, though its presence unfortunately may serve as a landmark to beings searching for potential points of entry into our world.\par

focus. These imprinted nodes then are dispatched throughout the bloom to infest the other nodes with the corrosive compounds. These compounds combine with the water nodes, causing a dramatically accelerated process of rust and corrosion to metal objects.
\par 
\tab Magick Effects: Identical to effects of {\i vaporbloom} (Petty Sorcery). In addition, in the second and subsequent rounds any exposed metallic object remaining within the bloom for more than one round is weakened by corrosion. \par 
\tab Weapons crumple and collapse when a 5 or 6 is rolled on the 1d6 damage roll in combat.  Metal shields or weapons used for a successful parry will crumple and collapse on a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6. \par 
\tab When metal armor is struck in a location where 5 or more p
oints of damage have been delivered (regardless of damage reduced by Toughness), the armor crumples and collapses on a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6. If subjected to stress, other metal items will crumple and collapse on a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6. \par

\tab Rationale: Air nodes acts as mirrors, reflecting light from the perimeter of effect.\par

lect a significant portion of light from the surface of the sphere, making the surface appear as a mirror to outside observers, while not interfering with the vision of those within the sphere, though the inner surface of the sphere appears to shimmer slig
htly. Objects and magickal effects may pass through this spherical surface without interference.\par 
\tab Since much light is reflected away from the interior of the sphere, the interior is only dimly lit from exterior light, though this does not significantly aff
ect the clarity of vision for observers looking outward from within the sphere. Light sources within the sphere, such as torches or lanterns, illuminate the interior of the sphere, and may be seem dimly from the exterior as dull points of light.\par

laying over and over again a fraction of a second of experience. The subject stops in his tracks, unaware of the passage of time or events around him. His mind ignores all sensations during the spell, even acute pain and discomfort.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The subject may test vs. WP to resist the spell\rquote s effects. If the test is successful, the spell has no further effect. If the test fails, the subject\rquote 
s mind is frozen in the moment, and his muscles become rigid, holding the body in its current position as if paralyzed.\par 
\tab 
Once affected by the spell, the subject remains frozen in mind and position until his muscles and mind become exhausted and he collapses. Test against Toughness x 5 at the end of each hour after the spell takes effect. If the subject fails, he collapses, 
and the spell\rquote s effect is broken, leaving the victim prone, but once against in possession of his mind and body. If the test passes, the subject remains frozen.\par 
\tab The victim affected by this spell is a {\b prone} target for melee attacks (see {\ul WFRP}, p. 116). \par 
\tab 
Notes: Ironically, the Tougher the subject, the longer he resists collapsing, and the longer he is paralyzed by the spell. Another method of interrupting the effects of this spell is rendering the subject unconscious, either by physical blows, or, more pr
udently, with a {\i deepsleep} spell. \par 
\tab When the victim regains control of his body and mind, he is unaware of the intervening events and passage of time, just as if time had stopped for him during the spell\rquote s duration.\par

\tab 
Circles may be inscribed with runes of certain spells and rituals (indicated by the symbol following the spell or ritual title). The caster may charge the circle with such spells and rituals as he knows, and the circle will retain the spell effects, disch

\tab 
Rationale: A section of the boundary between the Material Realm and the Void is separated from its matrix and temporarily manifested in the Material Realm. The substance of the boundary manifests as a coherent sheet of adhesive, fibrous, semi-solid materi
al called plasm. The surface and structure of the plasm are cloaked by elemental fire, producing a burning barrier.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: A one foot thick sheet of fiery plasm up to 6 yards long and up to 4 yards wide expands from a point at the tip of the caster\rquote 
s focus. The caster may orient the sheet at any angle relative to his position. The sheet of fiery plasm remains suspended where it is placed until the magick effect ends.\par 
\tab Any being or material coming in contact with the surface of the plasm receives 1d4 damage points at Strength 3, with 1d4 additional points of damage if the material is flammable.\par 
\tab 
A being may attempt to move through the fiery plasm sheet at standard rate if he tests vs. STR x 5; if he fails, he is trapped at the point of first contact for the remainder of the round. In subsequent rounds he must tests vs. STR x 5 to move through or 
to withdraw from the fiery plasm sheet. Each round that he is in contact with the fiery plasm sheet he takes damage as described above.\par 
\tab The sheet of fiery plasm may be oriented at any angle relative to the 
caster, and remains suspended in place without external support. In the round immediately preceding the reabsorption of the fiery plasm back into the Void (i.e., the disappearance of the sheet), the fiery plasm vibrates and becomes transparent, the only wa
rning one receives of the fiery plasm\rquote s impending disappearance.\par 
\tab When placed on a thaumaturgic form, the effect conforms to fit the form pattern (rather than forming at the caster\rquote s command). If Lesser or Greater Squares are linked (i.e., touching), the e
ffect may conform to other squares to the limits of its area of effect.\par 
\tab 
The substance of a sheet of fiery plasm is similar to wads of freshly-chewed bubble gum reinforced by numerous strands of elastic dental floss and coated with burning oil. The surface is extremely sticky, adhering to anything that comes into contact with 
it. A fiery plasm sheet obscures vision, and blocks arrows, bolts, sling stones, and other small missiles. The sheet itself cannot be moved by physical force; it is firmly rooted in th
e Void. The substance can be parted or pressed through by vigorous actions, but it closes up immediately afterward.\par 
\tab 
While forming, a sheet will not displace solid or living matter, but will displace fire, water, or air. Fiery plasm cannot be extinguished by normal means; if submerged in water, the fiery plasm causes no damage, but continues to burn. A sheet will not fo
rm around an obstacle; it stops expanding from the caster when it encounters a solid obstacle.\par 
{\v Tom Wylie}\par 
\tab Variants: Rumors exist of a Dark Elven variant which laces the plasm with corrosive compounds rather than fire, inflicting damage on metal contacting the plasm as per the {\i corrosionbloom} spell, above.\par

\tab Rationale: A section of the boundary between the Material Realm 
and the Void is separated from its matrix and temporarily manifested in the Material Realm. The substance of the boundary manifests as a coherent sheet of adhesive, fibrous, semi-solid material called plasm. The surface and structure of the plasm is stabil
ized and reinforced by elemental earth, producing a smooth, non-adhesive, durable surface suitable for use as a temporary bridge.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: A one foot thick sheet of reinforced plasm up to 36 yards long and up to 12 yards wide expands from a point at the tip of the caster\rquote 
s focus. The caster may orient the sheet at any angle relative to his position. The sheet of reinforced plasm remains suspended where it is placed until the magick effect ends.\par 
\tab 
Since the sheet of reinforced plasm may be oriented at any angle relative to the caster, and since the sheet remains suspended in place without external support, it may be improvised for use as a barrier, a wall, a ramp, etc. In the round immediately prec
eding the reabsorption of the plasm back into the Void (i.e., the disappearance of the sheet), the plasm vibrates and becomes transparent, the only warning one receives of the plasm\rquote s impending disappearance.\par

s command). If Lesser or Greater Squares are linked (i.e., touching), the effect may conform to other squares to the limits of its area of effect.\par 
\tab The substance of a sheet of reinforced plasm is similar in texture and durability to seasoned 
oak (Toughness 8, Damage 30), but of a bright green color with a luminous sheen. Even when punctured, the surface closes up afterward in 1d6 rounds. The sheet itself cannot be moved by physical force; it is firmly rooted in the Void.\par

Reagents: Void Salts*, thigh bone from magickal creature\par 
Resistance: (Toughness + Wounds) * 5\par

\tab Rationale: The caster assaults the victim\rquote s bones directly, causing one to shatter.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: One of the victim\rquote s limbs (arm or leg) is affected as if it had suffered a critical hit of 10 (see {\ul WFRP}, pp. 123-124). Further, the victim is considered to be at 0 Wounds if struck in that location (t
his special case ends if the victim is reduced to 0 Wounds normally, or the limb is healed). The victim receives a further +5% to his resistance roll for each point of armor enchantment covering the affected area, but an enchanted shield does not help. Thi

Area of Effect: One subject each round\par 
Reagents: Deleriants (1/20 dose)\par 
Resistance: WP\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: The caster forms thoughts and projects them through his Spirit into the mind of another being.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The being\rquote s mind processes the thoughts as if they were its own, though the mind recognizes the thoughts as having been introduced from another source, as if someone were speaking directly into the being\rquote 
s mind, phrased in the being\rquote s own language and imagery, in a voice similar to the being\rquote s own voice.\par 
\tab Each round the caster may form thoughts and project them into the mind of a single being in range. A new being may be chosen in each succeeding round. The caster\rquote 
s projected thoughts are limited to phrases which may be stated verbally in six seconds.\par 
\tab The target being instinctively translates the transmitted thoughts into terms he can best understand. Concepts beyond his comprehension are translated as incomprehensible gibberish.\par 
\tab This spell is effective only with beings which have speech. Animals and other speechless beings perceive the projected thoughts as incoherent noise.\par 
\tab The GM may judge how comprehensible projected thoughts are to their receivers. For example, \ldblquote Give up! You\rquote re surrounded,\rdblquote  projected into the mind of a goblin will translate exactly, but \ldblquote Hey, that\rquote 
s cruel and dishonorable!\rdblquote  is likely to be misunderstood by a goblin as praise and admiration.\par

Duration: Instantaneous\par 
Area of Effect: One victim\rquote s weapon\par 
Reagents: Void Salts*\par 
Resistance: Dex (and special, see below)\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: A spirit is summoned from the Void and briefly inhabits the victim\rquote s weapon, causing it to turn and attack him.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The weapon attacks its wielder once, with a WS equal to the caster\rquote 
s WP and a Strength equal to one-tenth his WP, rounded accordingly. Successfully resisting the spell does not counter it, but imposes a -20 penalty to the weapon\rquote s W
S (but see below). Once the weapon has attacked, it drops to the ground if its wielder failed to resist.\par 
\tab 
Weapons enchanted with lesser effects require extra MP to be so animated: +3 per enchantment and +3 per 10% chance of success, with 7 MP allowing a 10% chance to animate a weapon with a single enchantment. Greater artifacts and divine instruments are not 
affected. Daemon and spirit artifacts gain an additional test to resist based on the inhabiting spirit\rquote s WP; MP may be expended on both sides for this test. If the inhabiting spirit resists, there is no effect, and the wielder\rquote 
s Dex-based resistance need not be made. Natural attacks such as bite and claws are not affected by this spell.\par

\tab Rationale: The caster channels a momentary pinhole from the Void through the void membrane to the tip of his focus. Mundane matter touched by this pinhole is violently disordered.\par 
\tab 
Magick Effects: Any object, surface, or being contacted by the focus receives 2d6+6 points of damage, regardless of armor, but reduced by Toughness. Any target within 2 yards is touched automatically. The target may not parry, but may dodge; a successful 
dodge reduces damage by 1d6 points. Man-sized targets are thrown 1d3 yards by the blast and stunned for one round, during which they may take no other action than parry. Giant-sized targets are pushed back 1 yard.\par 
\tab The caster himself also receives 1d6 points of damage, regardless of armor, but reduced by Toughness, from the aethyrial backblast of this spell.\par 
\tab The forces released by this spell may damage the caster\rquote s focus. Each time the spell is used, roll 1d6; on a roll of 6, the focus is destroyed, and may not be used for further castings.\par 
\tab Note: A successful attack against the caster does {\b not} interrupt this spell. This is a unique exception to the rules in Chapter 2, Terms and Rules, \ldblquote Casting a Spell or Ritual\rdblquote

\tab Rationale: The caster causes a convulsive discharge of the victim\rquote s magickal energy reservoir into the surrounding aethyr.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The victim may test vs. WP to resist. If successful, the spell has no effect.\par 
\tab If the victim fails to resist, his MP are immediately reduced to zero.\par 
\tab Undead animated by spirits cease to be animated (i.e., skeletons, zombies, mummies, etc., collapse; if the body was magickally sustained, it may decompose in a matter of seconds).\par 
\tab 
Aethyrial undead, elementals, and daemons are not destroyed, but robbed of their magickal power, and cannot manifest in the Material Realm, nor affect the Material Realm in any way. In game terms, they disappear, while their Spiritual essences are drawn i
nto the Void.\par 
\tab To beings which sense magick, either successfully as a skill, or through a magickal spell or ability, the aethyrial discharge is a specta
cular visual display, a blinding flash of coruscating brilliance. Otherwise, there are no observable effects in the mundane world. The victim is aware of the draining as a sensation similar to having one\rquote 
s wind knocked out. Spellcasters, owners of magickal
 artifacts, and other beings familiar with voluntary discharge of magickal energy through spells, rituals, and activation of magickal artifacts will recognize that their magickal reservoir (their CMP) have been drained; other beings unfamiliar with volunta
ry creation of magickal effects may not understand that their MP have been drained.\par 
\tab This spell is most effective against spellcasters, but is also notably effective against non-spellcasters armed with magickal artifacts. Robbed of their MP, non-spellcasters cannot activate their magickal artifacts.\par

\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Spell\par 
Preparation: None\par 
Magick Points: 10\par 
Range: BMP yards\par 
Duration: Instantaneous\par 
Area of Effect: 6 yard radius sphere\par 
Reagents: Air and fire sublimates*\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: Air and fire nodes are summoned into two tiny, compact clouds. Each is imprinted with active compounds, then dispatched to a target, where they combine and explode in a violent fireball.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The tiny clouds form at the caster\rquote s focus and travel instantly to the chosen target, where they combine and explode, expanding instantaneously to a 6 yard radiu
s sphere. Target restrictions apply in the same way as for normal missile fire.\par 
\tab Victims within the volume of the fireball receive 1d6 wounds at Strength 6 and 2d4 additional wounds on flammable targets. Armor does not reduce damage, but Toughness does. Creatures test to resist fear of fire and/or magick if appropriate.\par 
\tab Victims may attempt to dodge the full effects. If an Initiative test is passed, the victim may move 1d3 yards If this carries the victim out of the fireball, then the victim takes only half damage.\par

\pard\plain \s1\qj \f18\fs28 Null Aethyr\par 
\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Magick Points: 6\par 
Range: Focus\par 
Duration: 1d6+6 minutes\par 
Area of Effect: 4 yard radius sphere\par 
Reagents: Aethyr salts*, void salts*\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: The aethyr within the magickal effect is excited, causing it to discharge its energy, which is diffused through the void barrier into the Void.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: For the duration of the effect, all aethyrial energy in range is drained, precluding its use in produci
ng magickal effects. Within the affected volume, all current spell or ritual magickal effects are interrupted and all magickal effects of enchanted artifacts are suppressed for the duration of the ritual. \par 
\tab 
All magickal spells or rituals in the area of effect are interrupted, ending their duration. No new spell or magickal effect can be cast within the area of effect for the duration, and any spell or ritual effects entering the area are also interrupted and
 terminated.\par 
\tab All active enchanted artifacts are deactivated when present within the area of effect. No artifact may be activated while within the area of effect.\par 
\tab Magickal and aethyrial beings within range at the beginning of the ritual are immediately displaced to the edge of the area affected by the ritual. Magickal and aethyrial beings can not enter the affected area.\par 
\tab Spirits (the aethyrial bodies of living, undead, and magickal beings) are reflexively compressed within the limits of the physical body while within the area of affect.\par 
\tab Magickal artifacts are not permanently affected by this ritual, though their functions are temporarily suppressed. Spell and ritual effects, however, are permanently terminated, and do not resume after the ritual effects have ended.\par 
\tab Aethyrial beings can not enter the area of affect. Thus, numerous spell effects dependent on conjured beings are repelled by the ritual, including fireballs (fire and air nodes), vaporblooms (water and air nodes), etc.\par 
\tab No spell or ritual effects are known to dispel magickal effects, other tha
n reversing the spell or ritual to be dispelled. Theorists propose that no such spell or ritual effects are possible. This ritual does not dispel magickal effects; rather, it denies them the source of magickal energy necessary to maintain their effects by 
shunting that energy into the void.\par

\pard\plain \s1\qj \f18\fs28 Regeneration\tab {\f13 9}\par 
\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Magick Points: 10\par 
Range: Touch with focus\par 
Duration: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Area of Effect: One subject\par 
Reagents: Troll generative organs*, aethyr salts*\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: A compound of troll generative organs and aethyr salts is administered to an injured subject, then activated by this ritual. The active ingredients in the potion cause the subject\rquote 
s flesh to regenerate like a troll while the caster monitors and guides the healing action through contact between the aethyr salts and the caster\rquote s Spirit.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The ritual heals all of the subject\rquote s wounds and removes all effects of critical hits tables, including amputation. This takes 1d6+3 rounds, during which all injuries heal, broken bones knit, and limbs are regrown. \par 
\tab The caster must concentrate on this effect during the preparation and duration of the spell, and may take no other action during this period.\par 
\tab This ritual is effective for any single living being which has wound points. It will not restore wounds or repair damage to skeletons, zombies, or other Undead. It will not restore wounds above a creature\rquote 
s characteristic score. It will not affect dead bodies (that is, bodies from which the Spirit has escaped). It will remove any effects of poisons, toxins, or deleriants, but does not cure disease, though it will restore any wounds lost to disease.\par 
\tab Note: This is a fun ritual to watch. The subject\rquote 
s body is surrounded by an aethyrial glow. The caster directs the healing by pointing the focus and concentrating his mind on the injury to be healed. The visual effect of wounds healing and lost limbs regrowing in seconds is a real show stopper.\par 
\tab WARNING: Chance of Harmful Side Effects! When spell is cast, test vs. Toughness x 10. If failed, suffer Shock effects (subject stunned, receives 1 Insanity Point, falls into deep autistic trance for 1d6 hours).\par

\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Magick Points: 10\par 
Range: Focus\par 
Duration: 1d6+6 minutes\par 
Area of Effect: 8 yard radius sphere\par 
Reagents: Aethyr salts*, void salts*\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: Similar to the {\i null aethyr} spell, this spell creates a \ldblquote null zone\rdblquote  along the edge of 
the area of effect. While magick works as normal within the area of effect, it ceases to exist along the edge of it, blocking or disrupting magickal effects.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: All magickal spells or rituals crossing the edge of effect are interrupted, ending their duration. No new spell or magickal effect can be cast across the edge of effect for the duration.\par 
\tab All active enchanted artifacts are deactivated when they cross the edge of effect, nor may any magickal or aethyrial beings. Such objects and beings can move freely within the area of effect, however.\par 
\tab Spirits (the aethyrial bodies of living, undead, and magickal beings) are confined to one side of the area of affect.\par 
\tab Magickal artifacts are not permanently affected by this ritual, though their functions are temporarily suppressed. Spell and ritual effects, however, are permanently terminated, and do not resume after the ritual effects have ended.\par 
\tab Aethyrial beings can not enter or leave the area of affect. Thus, numerous spell effects dependent on conjured beings are repelled by the ritual, including fireballs (fire and air nodes), vaporblooms (water and air nodes), etc.\par

\pard\plain \s1\qj \f18\fs28 SpiritWalk\par 
\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Magick Points: 8 (6 per extension)\par 
Range: Caster\par 
Duration: 1d6+6 minutes (extendible)\par 
Area of Effect: Caster\par 
Reagents: Aethyr Salts*\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: The caster places his bodily functions on automatic, separates his Spirit from his body, and cruises around like an aethyrial being. The ritual mai
ntains the body in a deep trance, sustains the integrity of the Spirit so that it remains self-aware, provides the Spirit with mobility, and permits the Spirit to rejoin with the body on its return.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The body remains at the site of the ritual within the ceremonial boundaries. Bereft of its Spirit, the body is extremely vulnerable. It is attacked physically as {\b prone}
, and it may not test to resist any magickal, psychological, physical, or other ability tests. The independent Spirit is not magickally linked to the body, and has no special way of knowing if the body is attacked or interfered with.\par 
\tab 
The Spirit of the caster is manifested as an insubstantial, invisible form otherwise identical to the naked body of the caster. This form may move about normally as if it had a body. (For example, it has the same characteristics as the original character.
)\par 
\tab Only magickal or enchanted objects may accompany the caster\rquote s spirit. If fact, only the aethyrial natures of these magickal or enchanted objects accompany the caster; the real objects remain with the caster\rquote 
s body. No other equipment or substances may accompany the caster. For example, an independent Spirit may be accompanied by his focus and an enchanted talisman, but may not be accompanied by the in
gredients or paraphernalia necessary for spell and ritual castings. (Note that this severely limits the caster\rquote s ability to cast spells, and prohibits the casting of rituals, while manifested as an independent spirit.)\par 
\tab To perform any activity not possible for a normal body, but possible for an aethyrial being, the caster must first pass a WP test to overcome the psychological resistance to performing \ldblquote impossible\rdblquote 
 actions. For example, the caster may fly or pass through solid objects if he passes a WP test. Failure of the test means the caster cannot force his body to follow his imagination; the task seems impossible.\par 
\tab While an independent Spirit, the caster may not interact with the Material Realm except through magickal means. The caster may, however, interact normally with aethyrial and magickal beings. (For example, the caster might grapple with a ghost.)\par 
\tab {\ul Clairvoyance}: In conjunction with Voidlink Message, this ritual permits a form of clairvoyance. The caster\rquote 
s Spirit enters the void through the aperture created by the spell, and uses the magickal Voidlink Message connection between the caster\rquote s focuses as lifelines.\par 
\tab The big problem with this \ldblquote clairvoyance\rdblquote  is navigation in the Void. The route of the Spirit to a linked focus is infallible and instantaneous (that is, takes one round).\par 
\tab Other routes require cautious void navigation. The duration of the Void travel is limited to the duration of the Voidlink Message effect. The Spirit can travel 100 miles in the Material Realm per round.\par 
\tab Over familiar routes, there is only a 1% risk of getting lost. A familiar route is a route which has been traveled over 10 times by the caster while in the real world (or as otherwise defined at the GM\rquote s discretion).\par 
\tab Over known but unfamiliar routes, there is a 10% risk of 
getting lost. A known route is one which has been traveled fewer than 10 times by the caster in the real world, or which the caster has never traveled, but for which he has detailed information about the route through maps or detailed directions.\par 
\tab Over unknown routes, there is a 50% risk of getting lost. An unknown route is one that has never been traveled by the caster, and for which the caster has no reliable maps or directions.\par 
\tab For each round that a caster is lost, he may test Intelligence to recover his way. A caster who is still lost when the {\i voidlink message} or {\i spiritwalk} effects expire becomes a ghost, and his body dies.\par 
\tab At the GM\rquote s discretion, a caster can practice and familiarize himself with an unfamiliar route in out-of-session play.\par

\pard\plain \s1\qj \f18\fs28 Strengthen Mind\tab {\f13 9}\par 
\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3 rounds\par 
Magick Points: 4\par 
Range: Caster\par 
Duration: 1d6+3 hours\par 
Area of Effect: Caster\par 
Reagents: Air, fire, water, earth herbal condensers and 1 dose deleriant\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: A
 compound of normally toxic psychotropic deleriants and herbal condensers is prepared and ingested. The caster alters the effects of these substances on his mind as the compound is metabolized, producing a temporary increase in the intensity and efficiency
 of the mind\rquote s functions.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The caster may increase the value of no more than one of the following profile characteristics by a maximum of +10: Ld, Int, Cl, or WP. The characteristic chosen may not be raised above 100. Casting a subsequent S
trengthen Mind spell cancels the effect of a previously cast Strengthen Mind spell.\par 
\tab 
Notes: The ingredients vary according to the characteristic to be affected; thus, casters should carry four separate mixtures of reagents for the deleriant potions. Unless used with this ritual, the compounds themselves are powerful toxins and deleriants,
 equivalent to twin doses each of a race-specific toxin {\b and} the Black Lotus deleriant.\par 
\tab WARNING: Chance of Harmful Side Effects! When spell is cast, test vs. Toughness x 10. If failed, suffer Toxic effects (1d6 wounds disregarding Toughness and armor).\par

\pard\plain \s1\qj \f18\fs28 VoidTravel\par 
\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 Discipline/Level: Battle Magick 4 Ritual\par 
Preparation: 1d6+3\par 
Magick Points: 10\par 
Range: Caster\par 
Duration: Instantaneous\par 
Area of Effect: Caster\par 
Reagents: Void salts* (1 measure per focus treated)\par 
Resistance: None\par 
\par 
\tab Rationale: The caster opens a portal to the void. A navigational link between two of the caster\rquote s focuses, one in his possession and the other at his intended destination, is created. The caster steps into th
e void and travels instantaneously along the established link to the focus at the intended destination, where another void portal has been opened. The caster steps through the second void portal at the location of the second focus. The void portals instant
ly close after the instantaneous transit of the caster from one location to the other. This instantaneous travel effect is called teleportation.\par 
\tab Magick Effects: The void portal assumes the proportions of the being who steps into it. If a being other than 
the ritual caster steps into the void portal, the being is instantly lost in the void (unless it has some means of moving and navigating in the void), and the void portal closes, ending the spell effect.\par 
\tab There are no limitations on the gear that may be carried by the caster, other than the caster\rquote 
s ability to carry the weight and bulk. Any living being carried by the caster also arrives with the caster at the intended location. Any living being in contact with, but not carried, by the caster as he steps th
rough the portal has a 50% chance of arriving at the intended location. If such a being fails to arrive with the caster, he is presumed to have become lost in the void, or to have been eaten by a daemon, or to have been dropped into another dimension by ac
cident.\par

\tab \ldblquote It\rquote s not like we could send orcs through to test these rituals. You got to send 4th level sorcerors. Lose just one, and we got a Guild incident on our hands.\par 
\tab \ldblquote And we already {\b tried} sending a lower rank wizard through with a 4th Ranker's focus. A portal opened at the other location, sure enough, but no spellcaster showed up. Listed as Missing in Action.\par 
\tab \ldblquote Once a foreigner (a wizard from Cathay, far as we can tell) showed up at someone else\rquote
