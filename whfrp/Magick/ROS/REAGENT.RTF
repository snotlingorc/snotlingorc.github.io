\par 
\tab Many tissues of dwarf, elf, halfling, and human cannot be collected without great harm to the individual. Pragmatic, moral, and ethical considerations limit the supply of derivatives of living and fresh humanoids in civilized society. 
Alchemists may purchase remains of humanoids to render for derivatives, wherever possible directly from relatives, who are permitted by law to sell a deceased\rquote s
 remains, or from the Watch, street cleaners, and keepers of poor hostelries, or, in extremis, from grave robbers. 
The Cult of Morr proscribes the sale of cultists for such purposes, but poor folk may prefer the prospect of a few gold coin in this world to the promise of eternal rest in the next. \par 
\tab In remote and wilderness regions, and on the black market, such humanoid derivatives may be easily obtained and inexpensive. The Guild a

}\pard\plain \qj \f16\fs20 \tab Many magickal creatures: dragons, unicorns, werecreatures, pegasi, giant bats, eagles, spiders, and so forth, are of elemental origin, and as such, substances derived from them may have magickal properties. Such magick
al creatures are typically associated with the elemental powers and sites of power (henges, leys, loci, nexi, and other locations associated with the worship of the Earth Mother). 
They may be permanent manifestations of the local aura, may periodically manifest according to celestial conjunctions and waxing and waning of the Earth Powers, or may be summoned periodically by Elementalists and Druids. 
The substance of such creatures is magickal, and as such often useful in a wide assortment alchemical preparations. However, since their magick is dependent on Earth Power, it is somewhat unpredictable and periodic in its effects. 
Note: Elementalists and Druids are prohibited from harming summoned Elemental Beings, and may not, in effect, import such beings for the purposes of alchemy. Further, they are enjoined against using such in alc
hemical preparations, and may as a matter of principle object to the use of such preparations by companions.\par 
\tab The substance of an elemental creature must be collected while the creature is still living and manifested as a material creature. At death, the body substance returns immediately to Mother Earth.\par

Note that Daemon Heart, a most precious substance prized for its alchemical properties, is exceptionally difficult to obtain, since it must be ripped still beating from the unfortunate daemon donor.\par
