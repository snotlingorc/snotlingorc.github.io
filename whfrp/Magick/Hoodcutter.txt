Legendary treasure (2): The Hoodcutter

 This powerful magical sword has it's place amongst legends. While being a
weapon of best quality and sharpness, it's most known from other ability. When
swung well, it can behead even three enemies standing around it's wielder or
in a row in front of him.
 The history lost the name of it's first owner, all it's remembered is that he
was priest of Ulric, fought at Sigmar Heldenhammer's side and died in great
battle against orc army.

 Now the details:
  The Hoodcutter is large (6 1/2 ft) 2-handed flamberg sword. It appears to be
just a normal, though larger than others, sword. There is however a drawing on
the blade, depicting three heads over a swordblade. The lines of this picture
glow dark red when orcs are nearby (though it's very hard to notice during
daylight).

  The Hoodcutter is very heavy and requires a Strength of at least 6 to be
wielded properly (else it's as if the wielder doesn't have appropriate skill -
even if he/she has it). If he/she has the strength, it can be used normally
even without 2-handed weapons skill. The Hoodcutter is magically sharp,
doing extra 3 points of damage. If the wielder deals a very successful blow
(ie. 6 on D6 and successful roll for extra damage), the Hoodcutter will cut off
target's head (critical effect #16 for head injury). For each next extra roll
it will cut head off another enemy standing close enough to the wielder. It is
assumed, that wielder may make up to full turn around cutting enemies' heads.
However, he loses any remaining attacks this round.

  The is one and only Hoodcutter. No one knows where it is, however legends
  say about that: either it is in the great orc stronghold in some conquered
  dwarven city or in the dreaded Castle Drachenfels.
