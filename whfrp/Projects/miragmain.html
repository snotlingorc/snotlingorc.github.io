Notes: Up to now I got several notes and remarks of how great and nice
=-=-=  people find the idea of developing a supplement for WFRP.
       This is the place to give my thanks to all of you who inspired
       me in writing letters and giving comments about this or that detail.
       Let me also thank each of the authors (please notice the list above).
       Everyone of you did (and may still do) a great job which will help
       WFRP players as well as GMs to revive their (favourite) game world.

       If you did not contribute up to now, this is the time to think
       about an engagement. I bet, you already have had some ideas of
       something needs to be realised in such a place of interest. Think
       of all the adventure ideas you already have had as a GM. Some of
       these will fit to this place, I guess. Even if you didn't have any
       ideas yet, read the following text and your fantasy will do the rest.
       So I'm asking you to begin working on this project. It only lives
       because people who are in no way different than you are were interested
       in giving something back to the game of what it gave to them during
       the years of playing WFRP.

0 MIRAGLIANO - a Tilean City State
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Miragliano is one of the four largest human settlements in Tilea.  Tilea
surrounds the Tilean Sea and is itself surrounded by several mountain
ranges.  The Appuccini Mountains lie to the east, the Vaults north-east, the
Irrana Mountains north and the Abasko Mountains to the west.

Miragliano lies on the north-eastern shore of the Tilean Sea.  It stands
upon hundreds of small islands, inter-connected by stone-banked canals.
Despite being one of the more prosperous Tilean cities, this ever-
growing settlement lies only some 30 miles east of the terrifying and
frightening Blighted Marshes - a very dangerous and deadly area that
hides the ruined city of Kavzar which is also called Maldiskaven in the
Tilean tongue and Skavenblight by others.

The landward side of Miragliano is barren, marshy and unpleasant, and is
perhaps deliberately kept that way in order to impede an attacking army.
Of course, there are routes through the marshland that join this prosperous
city with its neighbourly city states, but it would be an overstatement to
call any of these bog-ridden tracks a road.  Foul gases bubble to the
surface all the time and make a cross-country trip to Miragliano a rather
unpleasant one that will be remembered for a long time.  Despite this, the
city itself is airy and clean because of the Petrancialo, a warm and steady
wind blowing from Araby over the Tilean Sea.  But the Petrancialo is only
strong enough to disperse the fetid gases near the coast - the deep marsh is
a choking, poisonous place.

1       History
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Miragliano was founded by the Kasemattes, an ancient tribe hostile to the
Unberogens of the Empire.  After a great battle with the Unberogens, the
Kasemattes were driven south across the Vaults.  Of the hundreds that had
survived the fighting, still more were killed by marauding goblins and the
freezing temperatures.  They then had to cross the Blighted Marshes and by
the time they reached the edge of the Tilean Sea there were only 50 people
left - the Kasemattes were all but destroyed.

In the year 60 IC the ragged remnants of the Kasemattes emerged from the
marshes to discover the ruins of an ancient city.  It had been built across
several small islands in a huge bay.  The Kasemattes had been fishermen
before this and these islands in the calm, clear waters of the bay with the
teeming shoals of silver-finned fish were all that they could have hoped
for.  They settled down and built primitive houses to live in and boats to
fish from.

A year or two later the first diseases spread around.  The Kasemattes had
lost the will to flee and they placed their lives into the hands of the
gods.  They sacrificed their animals and prayed for help.  After an entire
week of fasting and praying another small, wandering tribe - the Ligures -
arrived and saw the same wonderful place.  Though the Ligures were over a
hundred strong they weren't agressive.  The Kasemattes and Ligures were able
to live together in harmony and their leaders signed a pact in blood.
When the diseases disappeared there were about 120 people left.  The few
remaining Kasemattes quickly learned the dialect and metallurgy from the
Ligures and gave them their knowledge of fishing and boat-building.

The bay was peaceful.  The fish plentiful.  Life was good.  It seemed to
both tribes a miracle that they had survived the marshes and the pestilence
to discover this tiny paradise.  It seemed so much a miracle that the
village's first leader called the place Mieracliano - a few hundred years
later that name would be corrupted to Miragliano.

Not long after the founding of the city rumors reached Remas and they sent a
delegation which pressed the city into the Tilean League.  Knowing that they
could not stand against Remas the city's leaders decided to join the league
but to be as passive and uncooparative as possible.

In 664 IC a meteor splashed into the Tilean Sea only a few miles away from
Miragliano.  A huge tidal wave rolled over the city; many buildings were
destroyed and many people perished.  The 'Legend of the Comet' suspects that
the meteor consisted of pure Warpstone.  Those who survived did not give
up.  Rumors of the 'falling star' and the destruction of Miragliano spread.
Those bent on plunder and easy looting descended upon the city, searching
through the ruins for hidden caches of gold and treasure.  The new arrivals
more than made up for the dead as most of them stayed on becoming
Mirgalianese themselves.  Remas' troops occupied the city at this time to
punish the looters (at least the ones who were not Remas' soldiers, of
course).  But the troops also helped to rebuild the houses and bridges which
had been destroyed during the catastrophy.

Two years later a series of strange incidents happened.  Some of the leaders
of the occupying forces were killed by a mysterious disease.  Only the upper
echelons were effected and not long afterwards all troops were withdrawn
from Miragliano.

2       Geography
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Miragliano is one of the largest seaports of the Tilean Sea; it is built
upon hundreds of small islands (see Map 01 - Miragliano's basement islands).
Buildings and streets are built upon stilts - most islands become flooded
during high tide, but building things upon slightly raised platforms
protects the stone and woodwork from the salty sea-water.  Islands are
joined to their neighbours by bridges and all have stopping points for ferry
gondolas.  The foundations of the upper-class buildings are, in most
cases, solid stone.  The other buidlings are built upon wooden logs.  In the
western part of the city one can see the ruins of a city wall which looks
like it might have been torn down during some ancient siege but was in fact
undermined by the salty sea-water and corrosive run-off from the marshes.
Nowadays relentless erosion by the elements is (for most people) the one and
only enemy to fight against: stilts are always needing to be replaced and
the walls of buildings shored up.

Some miles offshore lie the so-called "Shoals of Madness" and an ancient
legends tell the story of a little star falling down into the sea at this
point causing a catastrophy.  Only the most courageous of the city's sea
captains dare to navigate their ships through 'the shoals', although there
are a few captains who maintain that they have passed without any trouble.
But there are so many stories of crew members being driven mad or whole
ships being lost that most crews will refuse to sail through the rapids even
though some superstitions predict great luck and prosperity for the ship and
crew that does.

2.1     The City's Structure
----------------------------

As mentioned above Miragliano is built upon hundreds of small islands.
Almost all buildings are lacustrines.  There are many areas built over
open water where no island has ever been.  Over the years the network of
wooden supports has become a web connecting all the islands together - with
few exceptions.  In some places canals have been blocked to create a new
street or buildings.  The preferred material for the piles would be
stone but wood is cheaper and more readily available: unfortunately wood
rots very fast in the waters of Miragliano.  This weakens the structure of
the city and licensed crews of craftsmen are doing their best to repair and
re-repair the worst places all the year round.  Because this tends to be an
expensive but very necessary job, the citizens of Miragliano are taxed to
pay for it - the rulers are not going to foot the bill themselves if they
can possibly help it. (See the Restoration Tribute in "Taxes & Tribute").

Because ground has always been a scarce property in Miragliano only the
Eldest and the richest families can afford to own their own islands.  If you
own an island you have the right to connect it or disconnect it from any
nearby public ground and bridges whenever you want. The only concession you
must make is to build a landing place for gondolas and to follow the laws of
Miragliano.  Only a few islands have a sewer system and even those tunnels
lead quickly into the public and open channels between the islands.

Traditionally houses, bridges and streets, even whole districts are named
after the people who live or work there or after certain events which took
place there. An example of this tradition is the "Osteria dei Contrabbandieri"
(The Smugglers' Inn). Of course, nowadays no gang of smugglers would be stupid
enough to choose this inn as regular place to meet, but sometimes strange
foreigners still come inside and ask for someone who may handle some discrete
job.

There are some areas of the city (see Map 01 - Miragliano's basement
islands) where no islands break the water's surface.  To stabilize the
city's pile structure at these points a large number of buildings and
streets have been constructed on two levels with ramps and stairs.  This
means that many buildings and streets exist from where you cannot see direct
daylight.  In these areas the use of open fire and burning oil is forbidden
to prevent a flame inferno. <14>

The lower-level buildings are often used as warehouses or storerooms.  There
is a small community of dwarfs living 'down-under', but only the poorest of
the humans live in those dark and dangerous 'cellar'-level -- and of course
those who want to hide themselves from the daylight and/or from the city
watch.

Few people know that there are two different catacomb systems beneath the
city.  The first one is an ancient underground tunnel network on one of the
larger islands in the palace district.  It was used as a place to bury
people in but the tunnels have been sealed up long ago and the entrances are
marked on only a few VERY old maps.

The other catacomb system is a well-kept secret known only to the city's
leaders and some priests of Verena.  These tunnels are what is left of an
ancient underground city (see also 14 - Miragliano Secrets).

3       The Social Structure
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

As Miragliano developed as a city, it's original social structure changed.
It went from being organised in the feudal manner with nobility and loyal
subjects, to a city free of noble intervention.  As the city gained more and
more independence from the nobility of the area, new social structures
erupted.  A handful of families united and seized power fairly quickly, but
the fight for domination between these ruling families turned out to be long
and bitter.  It was not until 1812 and the outbreak of Red Pox that would
decimated the city's population (including many members of the leading
families) that the modern social structure was finally determined.  By then
four distinct classes had emerged:

   1 )   The Grassi
   2 )   The Guilds
   3 )   The Workers
   4 )   The Pitiful <17>

The Grassi gained control of the city's government, but within the Grassi,
the Great Families vie for ascendency.  The Dynasties and the rest of the
Grassi are of one mind when it comes to excluding the two lower classes from
power.

3.1     The Grassi
------------------

This is the socially and economically dominant group in the city. It is made
up of men - whatever their origins - who pursue aims different to those of
the Miragliano's nobility.  What makes the Grassi different from other
citizens of Miragliano, is that they are accustomed to greater wealth than
the others.  They are motivated by the prospect of profit and political
power within the city.

The Grassi's source of power is derived from three sources:

a) long distance trade
b) property within the city
c) control of the city's government

The Grassi is also in possession of rural property.  Rural property is the
only really secure investment in the Old World; but there are other reasons
too, for the Grassi's possession of rural property.  One is to secure and
control the regular supply of provisions to the city.  In this way the
Grassi make Miragliano dependent upon them for food - yet another factor
that helps keep them in power.

Most of the Grassi belong to one or the other of the old Miragliano
families, but there are quite a few self-made-men in this social group.  No
considerations are made to anybody's background or heritage; anybody that
makes it in the world of business and gains a license to do trade in
Miragliano, gains the status of Grassi.  Even some merchants from Araby have
gained Grassi status.

3.2     The Old Dynasties
-------------------------

The Old Families are the most powerful families of the Grassi.  After
centuries of careful political manoeuvring, these families emerged as the
most powerful.  When the Red Pox hit the city in 1812, the political
struggle that had lasted for several hundred years was abruptly brought to
an end. The political tension in the city was at the breaking-point. The
number of political assassinations was steadily growing as the battle for
the seats in the Dieci toughened.  There were over thirty Grassi families
fighting for the ten elected seats of the Dieci (see section 4.2, "The
political Bodies"), but then the Red Pox decimated the strongest Grassi
families, and by the end of 1812, ten of the Grassi families had emerged as
the winners of the struggle.  They made a united front against the seriously
reduced Consiglio Maggiore (see section 4.2, "The political Bodies"), and
passed the bill of 1812 which gave these families all ten places in the Dieci
as hereditary seats. The Old Dynasties had emerged.

Through intermarriage with each other and some of the other Grassi families,
the ten Great Families secured their power-monopoly.  These dynasties are,
the dominant political force in the city.  Each one is anxious to manipulate
the city's government and, above all, to use the power of taxation, in their
own interest.

The primary motivation of the Old Dynasties, is to secure their power-
monopoly.  They are extremely protective of their privileges and any new-
comers must play one Dynasty against the other to stand any chance of
surviving for long.  It was only through cunning manoeuvring that the
Cornuti family managed to replace the Fulvinis in 2475.  This incident is
explained below, but first we must explore its background.

Originally the title of Duce had no prestige.  It was merely the title used
for the chairman of the Dieci ('Duce' being the Tilean equivalent of 'the
first among equals').  The Duce was elected for life, but had no privileges
compared to the other members of the Dieci.  Over the years each successive
Duce managed to win greater and greater power for himself.  Each new Duce
added some extra privileges or powers to the the Ducal title, and by the end
of the 20th century, the position of Duce was more or less that of a despot.

After years of Skaven harassment from the Blighted Marshes, Duce Alfonzo
Fulvini of Miragliano began a crusade against the Skaven.  A great campaign
was mounted in 2192, and hired mercenaries from all corners of the Old World
and from as far afield as Araby.  They marched into the swamps:

    "Thousands were slain, but the Skaven were driven back to the
     Blighted Marshes and slaughtered without mercy."
                                    ('Death's Dark Shadow', pp. 9)

Along with the external campaign, Alfonzo began the uprooting of Chaos-cults
within the city boundaries.  The corruption he unearthed sparked off several
bloody years of intrigues and feuding, from which the Fulvini family emerged
victorious as the holders of a hereditary Ducal title.  They achieved this
political triumph through shrewd decisions, intelligent alliances, cunning
intrigues and some (quite a lot, actually) political assassinations.

The Fulvini supremacy was confirmed in 2253 with the Declaration of
Traditional Authority which secured the Fulvini family the Ducal seat as a
hereditary title. If, by any chance, the Fulvini should run out of heirs,
then the title was to pass to the second greatest of the Old Dynasties, the
Cornuti.  If any of the Cornutis was unable to produce a heir to the title,
it should pass to the Cielvinis... etc.

With this in mind, the Cornuti family began the systematic murder of the
Fulvinis in 2473.  The Cornuti were able to kill all of the Fulvini family
(or so they thought; see 'Deaths Dark Shadow', pp53). The official story of
the Fulvini is that they all died of a strange disease.  So today (2515) the
Cornuti family are in power of Miragliano.  Their partners in crime during
the coup d'etat was the Feccia family - originally nobles from the town of
Portomaggiore.  They took the seat of the Fulvini in the Dieci.  The intro-
duction of the Feccia to the Dieci was not without protests from the other
Old Dynasties, but through political manoeuvring, the Cornuti were able to
install their allies in the Dieci.

In recent years the discontent amongst the eight other families of the Dieci
has led to uprisings against the Cornuti.  The discontent is over the
Cornuti's constant erosion of the other families' power.  Step by step the
Duce has deprived the Dieci of it's powers.  The Duce's closest political
advisor, Micco di Bartolomeo Vachiamelli, has warned him of the dangers of
the Dieci's/the other Dynasties' bad will, but the power mad Duce seems to
ignore Vachiamelli's warnings.

3.2.1   Other Important Persons/Clans
-----

* The Cielvini family

  Giacomo Cielvini is the current head of this family, and has single-
  handedly taken them from the verge of bankrupcy to a life of luxury and
  power.

  In the early 1000's, a small merchant family from the Estalian city of
  Magritta settled in the young and rapidly growing city of Miragliano.
  Despairing of the cut-throat competition in Magritta they had come hoping
  to find a place for themselves in the expanding markets of this city.
  Thanks to their contacts in Magritta they soon made a small fortune
  for themselves by virtually cornering all trade with Estalia.  Claiming
  to be the only reliable businessmen in the region, they became one of
  the richest families in Miragliano.

  Though they were now wealthier than they had ever imagined, they had also
  grown fond of the gold.  They crafted an agreement with Magritta's
  officials, informing the Estalian sea forces of the comings and goings
  of other craft, and then splitting the profits from these bordings.
  Though they staged attacks on their own ships from time to time to divert
  attention, their gains were still astronomical.  A few years later, the
  Cielvini family found their place amongst the older and more influencial
  families in the area, using their money to support this candidate or that,
  bribing etc.

  After the plague of 1812, they were established as one of the most
  powerful of the Old-Dynasties.

  As they began to rest on their laurels, many of their trade routes were
  leased out to other merchants, and by avoiding all the tedious trade work,
  they began to concentrate on the more comfortable things in life such as
  art, theatre and politics.  Many of their trade connections faded, so did
  their influence on Magritta's sea forces.  From now on the Cielvini would
  steadily lose more and more power.

  In many of the greater families throughout the Old World heavy inbreading
  leads them to the verge of extinction.  The Cielvini faced that problem
  a few decades ago.  The head of the family, Paolo Cielvini, was little
  more than a walking vegetable, a puppet in the hands of his cousins and
  other influencial businessmen.  As long as he was kept warm, well fed and
  had plenty of new toys to play with, they could do whatever they wanted in
  his name.  Planning intrigues and neglecting official political business
  they left him alone with his seat in the Dieci, using his position from
  time to time.  So they were surprised and helpless, when Paolo refused to
  attend the Dieci anymore, claiming that it was all too boring, and that he
  actually fell asleep during his last visit. The other families in the
  Dieci didn't take offence at this, realizing that they would all have more
  power without the Cielvini present.

  Paolo financially supported anything that caught his fancy or that was
  told him by his advisors. He himself came up with such notable ideas as
  the Cielvini hat, a three feet tall, 20lb weighing monstrous hat, the two-
  storied gondola, which invariably tipped over as soon as someone set foot
  on the top floor and didn't bother with the fact that this gondola would
  be too tall to pass under most of Miragliano's inner city's bridges.
  Incredibly enough, he was never discouraged by his failures, and he kept
  on inventing till the day he died.  The result of his "investments" for
  his family was a financial catastrophy unlike anything seen since in the
  history of Miragliano.

  Paolo was married to Lucilia, a young woman from one of Magritta's noble
  houses - a fact that was kept secret because of the strained relationship
  between Miragliano and Magritta.  The pair produced two male offspring
  despite the fact that Lucilia hated him passionately until her dying day.
  The first-born son was named Luigi, and inherited many of his father's
  features, including his intelligence.  The second one was called Giacomo;
  he proved to be the man his father never was.  The two were so different
  that rumours sprung up that Paolo cannot be Giacomo's real father, but
  that the boy was a result of an affair between Lady Lucilia and the
  merchant Firenco Golini.

  During his twelve years as the head of the Cielvini family, Paolo managed
  to destroy what had taken them centuries to be gathered.  He was finally
  killed by his son Giacomo.  Giacomo soon discovered that he was more cold-
  blooded, intelligent, sharp-witted and tougher than both his father and
  his elder brother, though he decided not to show how superior he really
  was.  Giacomo's early years were not happy ones.  His father neglected the
  rest of the family and his mother was too busy pursuing her amorous
  interests elsewhere. The two children were left to be cared for by Pepina
  Diacomo a strict, merciless and alcoholic governess, who often beat the
  children for the fun of it, knowing that nobody would notice.  Giacomo began
  to hate his lot in life.  He not only hated his governess, but he learned to
  hate everybody around him.  He hated and loathed his father for being the
  fool and the puppet that he was, his mother for tolerating his father and his
  brother for his stupidity.  He also hated the domestics for their subserv-
  ience to such a rabble of a family.  At an early age he learned the value
  of information, and the power it could give him if he used it at the right
  moment.  He learned that having information that others wanted kept secret
  was important.  He could blackmail and threaten people into acting as he
  wanted them to.  So he spied out everything and everone in his
  surroundings, and always kept alert for new information. He soon began to
  blackmail his governess and some of his father's advisors, his elder
  brother and Lucilia followed soon after.

  After meeting Firenco Golini at a ball, he began to like the man.
  Firenco, knowing there was a good chance the boy was his son, took pity on
  him.  They started meeting secretly and Firenco became Giacomo's teacher
  and his only friend.  It was Firenco who taught him how to run a business
  and how to negotiate.  In effect, Firenco laid the foundation for the
  resurection of the Cielvini dynasty in more than one way.  The boy was not
  only Firenco's son, it was from Firenco that Giacomo learned to raise the
  fortune he one day would.

  But, alas, one of Paolo Cielvini's advisors noticed that Giacomo met
  Golini and gave orders to arrest the merchant.  He was caught while
  sneaking out of Lady Lucilia's bedroom, and executed the very next day.
  The news of his death struck both mother and son very hard. Lucilia went
  into a self-imposed seclusion, refusing to eat and drink until she died of
  hunger and thirst ten days later.  Giacomo, on the other hand, swore
  revenge upon his family and advisors.  But he did't show any of his
  emotion, he waited for a time when he would be old enough to take revenge.
  So he waited, plotting and studying, biding his time.  Several advisors
  were found dead without explanation, other businesses crumbled as rumors
  spread slandering an advisor's integrety or saying that they were spies
  from Remas or similar.

  In this way, Giacomo realised his revenge; never missing his mark, always
  watching and waiting for the perfect opportunity to use certain inform-
  ation, never forgiving or showing the slightest bit of mercy or hesitation
  in his revenge.

  The first one to fall was his older brother.  A golden opportunity arose
  that was too good for Giacomo to miss.  The governess and Luigi were out
  on a picknick when Giacomo forced her - by threatening to reveal her
  sexual perversions - to help him drown the first-born son in a canal.
  Claiming that they had fallen prey to bandits, they convinced the others
  that Luigi had been kidnapped by his father's enemies.  Nobody suspected
  him when the body of Luigi was found by the river patrol guard, floating
  in the canal, making Giacomo the new heir.

  But he had to tie a few loose ends before he could proceed with his
  revenge - a lesson taught to him by the death of Firenco.  He sneaked into
  the room of the governess, carefully taking care not to wake her, and
  strangled her in her sleep.  Giacomo was by no means a muscular man and he
  had some trouble in putting a rope around her neck and hoisting her up
  into the air to make it look as if she had hung herself.  The next
  morning, a suicide note telling of her feelings of guilt for Luigi's death
  was conveniently found on her bed.  Giacomo could now be sure he was safe,
  nobody could possibly know the truth about his brother's murder.  All the
  witnesses were gone, leaving him free to concentrate on the only family
  member left - his father.

  Adventure Note: There is one loose end left that Giacomo failed to take
                  care of.  The governess used to write down important
                  events in a diary. Giacomo knew that - the governess'
                  diary was the source of his knowledge about her
                  sexual preferences.  She used to hide it in her desk but
                  Giacomo took it and burned it because he knew that there
                  were several hints in it that he had blackmailed her.  But
                  he didn't take a look before he burnt it and so failed to
                  notice that the last entry was over two weeks ago ! The
                  governess had begun a new diary because the old one was
                  full.  This new diary contains the last part of the story
                  and contains several hints of Giacomo's role in the
                  tragedy.  The second diary is hidden under a (not too)
                  loose floor plank.  It has not been found by anyone since
                  then and nobody knows about it, except the soul of the
                  governess.

  Revenge had to be sweet for the death of his true father, so he planned
  and plotted for a long time, letting everyone else fall back into a normal
  everyday life. But Giacomo never forgot and he never forgave.  He played
  the role of the good son until he had gained the confidence of even the
  most sceptical of his father's advisors.

[The greatest families of Miragliano will be developed further]

3.3     The Guilds
------------------

The Guildsmen are all full members of the craft guilds, whose masters
represent the middle class.  They are a respectable group, even though they
are politically underprivileged.  The Guildsmen are largely concerned with
local produce and local services.

Their power derives from control of production and trade of craft products
and the control of raw materials brought in from the countryside around
Miragliano.

3.4     The Workers
-------------------

These are the ill-organised masses of the Miragliano citizenry. They are the
city's lower class.  The workers work on contracts, or are employed on a
daily/weekly/monthly basis.  They are totally deprived of political power,
and are at the mercy of the two other social classes.

3.5     The Pitiful
-------------------

Miragliano has been regularly hit by diseases and plagues.  To prevent the
spread of disease every person inside the city borders (which legally begin
in the marshes some 25 miles outside the island area) who shows signs of
being infected will be arrested and examined by a doctor or a healer.  If
the diagnosis is verified then this person will be put into a special coach
and transported to a camp in the marshes some 20 miles away.  This large
camp is well away from any main roads or other settlements.  It is a plague
camp and is called the Aeger Asylum.

The camp is surrounded by a huge palisade and it is forbidden to pass in any
direction without permission from the city-state government.  The penalty
for counteracting is death by burial while being alive.

There is a small garrison called Casteocci nearby and there are regular
patrols to ensure that nobody climbs the palisade.

Everyday carts with supplies come to the garrison outpost.  From here food
and water is let down over the palisade and into the camp area.  Once a week
a group of three physicians are allowed to visit the camp and help where
they can to soothe the pain or heal disease.  No visits are be permitted
but the physicians might agree to deliver something - unofficially - to
someone inside the camp or to gain information. Sometimes, but not on a
regular base they are accompanied by a few priestesses of Shallya.

At the moment only 40 people live here and some of them have survived for
more than ten years in the camp.  Nevertheless, coming to this area is a
one-way ticket.  There is no way to return other than to escape.  Knowing
this, Miragliano's leaders ordered that anyone sent going to this isolation gets
a solid metal ring forged around his neck tight enough to prevent its
removal by simply drawing it off.  Engraved on this ring is the following
sentence (in Tilean) :

    "This person is a bearer of diseases.  He has been imprisoned and is
     sentenced to death when seen outside his camp!"

To finance the support of the camp and the garrison the government has
decided that each family has to financially support their own relatives.  If
this isn't possible, the personal property of the infected will be confis-
cated and the support will be limited to the lowest amount.

A map of this camp exists - refer to Map 02 (See 16.2 for further details).

3.6	Population in the Marshlands
------------------------------------

In the marshlands to the north and west there are very few people.  There
is the old outpost of Casteocci - which guards the Plague Camp - and there
are the Mulatores, the hunters of the marshes who work alone or in pairs who
have secret, well-hidden huts and places they have marked as safe to sleep
in. But quite apart from these two groups there are the Maldisi - people
who have ...

3.6.1	The Maldisi
-----

The Maldisi used to trade their marsh-paper with the merchants of Miragliano
and profited handsomely by it.  Now, though, Dwarven advances in technology
have seen the rise of paper made from wood-pulp and the bottom has fallen
out of the paper/vellum market.  Where there were perhaps 20 companies all
vying for Maldisi marsh-paper, there is now only one and the effects on the
Maldisi have been catastrophic.  Unable to earn enough money to buy goods
and even basic foodstuffs for their marsh-villages, their expanded popul-
ation has incresingly turned to banitry and pilaging.  They have even way-
laid the good doctors and physicians of Miragliano on route to the plague
camp.  As a result the Miragliano Grassi have petitioned the Dieci to outlaw
the Maldisi.  Unfortunately the Dieci can't do this without the Duce's
authority and he is still perversely ignoring their wishes in all matters.
Even so, the Maldisi are unofficially persona non grata in the city and the
last one to be found within its walls was lynched over a month ago.

The only merchant still trading with the Maldisi (and he is increasingly
being looked upon as a traitor to Miragliano because of this) is the
Brolleus the Elder.  He still sends a buyer every month to the marshes to
trade for marsh-paper - at rock-bottom prices!

[more on the Maldisi in preparation]

3.6.2	Mulatores - The Hunters
-----

The land around Miragliano is pretty desolate.  If it is not marsh then it
is ragged moorland.  Most trade comes to the city by sea but, despite this,
there are several overland routes that cut through the wilderness surround-
ing the city.  These routes are not easy.  The moorlands and the marshes are
home to bandits and the sullen Maldisi.  The Marsh Wolf has defied many
attempts to exterminate it, and stranger creatures like the Slagworm or
Weregoats still plague the trade-routes from time to time.

In order to make the roads safe for travellers, the City-State actively
employs people to track down and destroy the more dangerous creatures.
These hunters are called Mulatores and are adept at surviving in the marshes
or out on the moors.  The Mulatores are paid a fixed monthly rate - which is
not enough to live off, but is considered more of a retainer for their
services than an actual wage.  They may make whatever profit they can off of
their kills - this basically means Marsh Wolf pelts, which are poor at best.
And they also accompany merchant caravans from the outposts of Casterori or
Castebore to the city gates.  Those that undertake to roam the Marshes to
the north and west of the city, get a slightly higher wage, as the Marsh is
a more dangerous area - not least because of the Maldisi!

The people of Miragliano are respectful towards Mulatores as they are viewed
as skilled and cunning fighters.  But despite this respect, the common
people cannot be said to like the hunters.  They are rumoured to be in
league with the Maldisi.  And their "protection" has had certain suspicious
lapses over the last few years with important caravans or visitors failing
to arrive or vanishing on the way back.

Both points are valid.  The Mulatores are known to the Maldisi and though
only a few would claim to be friends with them they realise what has driven
them to attack and plunder the caravans.  To oppose the Maldisi would only
turn them against the Mulatores - and there are many, many more Maldisi who
know the marshes far better than the Mulatores.

See section 13 for the changes to the Hunter career if being a Mulatore.

4       Politics
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The leading merchants of Miragliano have from the city's earliest days as a
small trading-town, made demands on the local lords for privileges and
independence.  As the city grew, it considered itself an independent
administrative body, apart from the local lords.

4.1     The legacy of Arismio del Padloa
----------------------------------------

In 1030 the famous philosopher Arismio del Padloa wrote "Civic Liberta".
The main theme of the Civic was the city's 'sibi princeps' - the city as
it's own master, and a corporation with omnipotent jurisdiction.  There only
exists one law -- a positive and coercive law -- and this is applied in any
community by one ruling instrument, the 'pars principans'.  The 'pars
principans' of the city is chosen by the citizens as a whole, 'having regard
to their quality', i.e. that not everybody has the power to elect the 'pars
principans'.  The ruling instrument of the city, the city's government, is
responsible for the control of all other groups in the community, including
the clergy.

Arsimio's thoughts and ideas were controversial in his age, but since the
publication of the Civic, the city's rulers have used it to legitimise their
independence; and it is still extremely relevant in the struggle for power
in Miragliano.

As the city demanded more and more independence from the surrounding lords,
the city's ruling class, the Grassi, had to organise the city into it's new
role: as a corporate body responsible for it's own defence against foes
within and without; as a collector of taxes to build and maintain those
defences; as the formulator of policy to encourage trade and to protect
those trade routes and to ensure a steady supply of food and raw materials
to the city.

4.2     The political bodies
----------------------------

But there is plenty of room for re-interpreting the Civic - in this way the
political bodies of Miragliano have emerged.  Much of the political tension
in Miragliano derives from the conflict between the Old Dynasties and the
Duce about which governing body is now the 'pars principans'; the Dieci
where the Old Dynasties have some power, or the Duce.

The three political bodies of Miragliano are as follows:

4.2.1   The Consiglio Maggiore (Grand Council)
-----

The first political body to proclaim itself as del Padloa's 'pars
principans', was a council of merchants which was called the Grand Council,
or in Tilean: il Consiglio Maggiore.  This council worked hard to gain new
privileges and a certain independence from the local overlords. The
Consiglio Maggiore only met once a year.  It's primary functions was to
elect ten representatives which would form the city's government - called
the Dieci, for the coming year.  The Dieci was led by a chairman called the
Duce.  The Duce was elected for life by the Consiglio Maggiore.  This was
done by a complicated alternation of vote and lot.

The procedure was as follows:

    1) the entire body choses thirty of it's members by lot
    2) the thirty are reduced to nine, by lot
    3) the nine elect a body of forty
    4) the body of forty is reduced to twelve by lot
    5) the twelve elect a group of twenty-five
    6) the twenty-five are brought down to nine by lot
    7) the nine elect forty-five
    8) the forty-five are reduced by lot to eleven
    9) the eleven elect a committee of forty-one
   10) these forty-one elect the Duce

This complicated system was designed to prevent strong merchant families
from growing even stronger by holding onto Ducal title for several gener-
ations.  Even so, the system was far from perfect.  Each stage took at least
a day to organise.  Voting in the Consiglio Maggiore was done secretly, a
legislation pushed through by some Consiglio Maggiore representatives (led
by Archibald "Bribe" - who got his nickname after saying: "Everybody has his
price, some are only a bit more expensive than others") in 1646.  As might
be expected, the two elections were plagued by corruption.  The most
powerful representatives of the Consiglio Maggiore used to bribe, blackmail,
intimidate, etc. their way into the titles they wanted.  Thus the system,
designed to prevent the strong from growing stronger, actually worked in the
favour of the strongest; those with enough money and hired thugs bribed and
cajoled their way to the top.

When the Red Pox hit in 1812, the number of representatives for the
Consiglio Maggiore dropped sharply as large numbers of the city's population
succumbed to the plague.  With the Council in a weakened state, the ten
strongest families (i.e. the families that were powerful before the plague,
and had managed to survive the plague's worst ravages) brought about a coup
d'etat, and passed a bill that secured their positions in the Dieci.  From
that date on there has never been an election, neither for representatives
to the Dieci, nor for a new Duce.  From 1812, the Consiglio Maggiore had, in
reality, no powers.

In order to placate the Consiglio Maggiore and it's still powerful Grassi
representatives, the Dieci claim to use the council as an advisory body to
propose new bills, so that the Dieci may know what the needs and wishes of
the 'people of Miragliano' are.  After the overthrow of the Fulvini, the
Cornuti Duce has restricted the power of the Consiglio Maggiore, and over
six years have passed since any of the council's bills has been passed by
the Duce.  The discontent is growing with each year that passes, and some of
the representatives of the Consiglio Maggiore have, in secret, been speaking
about an armed uprising in order to 'show the Cornuti bastard who's got the
real power of Miragliano'.

4.2.2   The Dieci
-----

As long as it has existed, the Dieci has been the real government of
Miragliano.  To begin with it consisted of ten representatives elected on
yearly terms by the Consiglio Maggiore (as explained above), and led by it's
chairman, the Duce, who was elected for life.  After the coup d'etat of 1812
the elected representatives of the Consiglio Maggiore were exchange with one
representative for each of the ten most powerful families of Miragliano,
also called the Old Dynasties.  These ten families intended to hold onto
their seats in the Dieci for 'all time to come'.  The Dieci had become a
permanent government in Miragliano, drawn from the ten most powerful
families of the city.

As the years passed, the Duces gained more and more power; power which they
took from the Dieci, and by the end of the 20th century, the powers of the
Dieci had diminished.  It was no longer the government of Miragliano, it had
been turned into an advisory body for the Duce.  But the Dieci was not the
Duce's only advisors.  As the representatives of the Dieci were out to make
the best for themselves, the Duces had to depend upon advisors which they
could trust.  A new class came into existence: a class whose wealth was
dependent upon the Duce; in this way the Duce could guarantee their loyalty.
The power of the Duce's new advisors was their knowledge, not their wealth.
The more successful the Duce was, the more they earned.  Still, the new
advisors knew how to make the best out of their situations, and it was not
unknown for advisors to abuse their employer's trust...

4.2.3   The Duce
-----
As time passed, the Duces became despots. The responsibilities of the Duce
were diverse.  He is responsible for the running of the city as a smooth
profit-making machine.  He is in control of legislation - but passes nearly
none of the bills proposed by the Consiglio Maggiore; tax collecting;
chartering licences for merchants trading in the Miragliano area; the city's
foreign policy; and protection of the trade routes within the boundaries of
the City-State.

To lighten the burden of the Duce, several offices are organised to take
care of the paper work.  Most of these offices are ad hoc arrangements, but
there are two permanent offices:

   + the Chancery: a small writing office staffed by clerks and lawyers
   + the legal administration<29>

5       Trade in Miragliano
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

5.1     Currency
----------------

Because Miragliano is a great trading city you are able to pay most bills
(at least those from tradesmen) with the Empire's currency.
Nevertheless Miragliano has its own currency :

1 Doblono (Db) = 60 Ducati
1 Ducato  (Dc) = 600 Kreutzer (Kr)

One Gold Crown (1 GC) is worth 12 Ducati.

The following is a list of coins available in Miragliano :

   Miragliano Coins          Empire Value

        1Db                      5GC
        1Dc                      20d

       50Kr                   no exchange
       30Kr                       1d
       10Kr                   no exchange

5.2     Trade & Transport
-------------------------

One can enter Miragliano by boat, by travelling from one of the other City
States (maybe Campogrotta in the north-east or Udolpho in the north).  If
you arrive at one of the port islands and want to leave the boat you are
assumed to be a trader and therefore ordered to pay Trade Tax.  This is
obligatory if you want to leave the ship.  If coming from the landward side
you're asked if you're a trader or not.  Traders pay the tax (guess its
name) or may return to whence they came.  Other persons are declared un-
welcome unless they pay for their right to stay in Miragliano.  For other
taxes and tributes see the section "Taxes & Tributes".

It is very expensive to bring animals into the city (See Law to Prevent the
Risk of Catching Diseases).  Aside from this fact, you're not allowed to
ride over most of the city's bridges because of their instability.

A lot of traffic takes place in the hundreds of narrow water canals.  It
means as much to a wealthy family to possess their own gondolas with
Gondolieres as staff as it would do for such a family in the Empire to have
their own coaches.

Each island (or almost each island) has its own name, so do some bridges and
the majority of the "canal"s.  There are a lot of hauliers to hire for
passenger transport waiting for clients at one of the gondola parks and
normally a passenger shouldn't have any problem at daylight to catch one
of them at a canal not too narrow or secluded from the the better-class
city districts. But most Gondolieri don't like to go to the more dangerous
districts at night. At this time you can bet on someone looking out for a
profitable victim to rob, murder or to do nastier things with. From time to
time a Gondoliere who has been to bold just vanishes together with his
clients and rumours circulate amongst the Gondolieri that they end up as
sacrifice in evil rituals or weird experiments.

Miragliano is a great trading city which known throughout the Old World for
their small, light ships that often sail as far afield as the South Lands.
There are well established trade routes with Araby to the south and Marien-
burg and Erengrad to the north.  Among the famous captains that have
successfully completed the dangerous voyage to the New World are several
sons of Miragliano.

Obviously the best and most important is Giuseppe de'Pompadoro who has made
it eight times to Apachia-Bora, a settlement of primitive humans which was
called "New Heaven" by the Miragliano discoverers.  The city's leaders plan
to declare this part of the New World Miragliano territory and intend to
equip a huge expedition to Apachia-Bora to subdue the natives as soon as
they have the financial funds to do so.

Miragliano is also well-known for its money-lenders.  Some of the wealthiest
people of the City-Upon-The-Sea have made their fortunes in this business.
Nearly anyone who can afford it can borrow any amount of money.  But
Shallya's Mercy to those who cannot pay the bills...

A couple of large banking-houses have settled in Miragliano making this
city Tilea's most important financial centre. One of them is the Mandragorra
Bank which has a large amount of influence among the Grassi families. Another
one is the Piedruccini Bank which has also agencies in Altdorf, Marienburg
and Gisoreux.

5.2.1   Water Trade
-----

Miragliano is a city with almost no natural water reservoir.  Nevertheless
the city needs a lot of fresh water in order to survive.  A lot of marsh-
traders deal with rainwater or water from one of the rivers coming down from
the mountains.  Over the years a number of water traders have established
themselves in Miragliano and tried to build up a monopoly.

But most of Miragliano's important families were interested in fair and/or
cheap prices for water, so a monopoly of few traders was to be avoided by
being not too reserved in giving out licenses for importing fresh water.
So many traders competed against each other and the prices were only raised
in small ammounts.  Of course, even under these circumstances some of the
more important water traders gathered a fortune.

About 60 percent of the imported water is sold to the city itself via one of
the water prospectors, who have a fine job, until they purchase poisoned or
diseased water, of course. Part of these water reservoirs are distributed
among the people for a small fee, other parts are held back or used for the
city's military. The other 40 % of the imported water are sold on a free
market.

6       Guilds, Circles & Secret Societies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The city of Miragliano has quite a lot of public and private guilds and
societies.  Almost all important decisions are arranged amongst the
membership of one or more of the most powerful of those circles.

Membership is also a kind of rating system.  The more societies a person has
influence in, the more powerful he is and the more respect is shown to him.

* The Preservers' Lodge
  At the moment there are only 9 members in this top secret society.  Their
  aim is to keep the power at the hands of Miragliano's present rulers.
  To achieve this they have a very simple and strict order.  Any potential
  threat to the status quo may be spied out and eliminated if shown to be
  worthy of atatention.
  Actually only the members themselves know about the lodge and their aims.
  GM Note: One member is Salvadore Cornuti - a brother of the Duce di
           Miragliano - who is also a member of the Consiglio Maggiore.
           Another member is very high up in the local assassins' guild -
           he or she is the person who allocates the task of elimination to
           his subordinates.  It is NOT known publicly who this person is !

* Sindica Mutuale di Nauti Fluviali
  A powerful guild which has a strong membership amongst the river boatmen
  of northern Tilea.  They influence is strongest on the River of Echoes,
  in Campogrotta and Alimento.  In Miragliano they are only a second-
  rate guild.

* The Patriots
  This secret debating club would be proud to be called an organization.
  What makes this loose collection of traders, former servants and never-
  satisfied naggers worthy of mention is the subject of all their debates.
  They don't want the Fulvini to have have the office of the Duce de
  Miragliano.

  Despite the fact its members don't take any action except to "debate" how
  nice and lovely the good old times were, the Duce, his friends and allies
  are always interested in laying hands on traitors to home and country.

* Cacciabores dell' Ombra
  This is the Assassins' Guild of Miragliano.  This guild is not under the
  control of the government as are those of other countries (or city-
  states).  Instead, the Cacciabores dell' Ombra operate as an independent
  business entity, albeit a secret one.  All of their customers are treated
  equally in terms of having the opportunity to reach a business agreement.
  Obviously, the one offering the best terms for the Cacciabores will find
  their contracts honored above any other.

  The Cacciabores dell' Ombra were founded in the late 1700s when the power
  struggle between the Old Families was reaching fevered pitch.  Business
  was brisk, but came crashing down when the Red Pox of 1812 decimated the
  Old Families.  It was through the efforts of Guildmaster Alberto Luciano
  that the Cacciabores survived the ensuing lean period and retained their
  political clout.

  As an organization, the Cacciabores dell' Ombra have no political
  affiliation and hire their services to the highest bidder.  They influence
  the political structure in a very direct way.  Any threat to the their
  business is violently met.  The most recent example was the Fulvinis'
  attempt to expose the Cacciabores dell' Ombra in 2472.  For a lower than
  normal fee from the Cornuti and Feccia families, the Cacciabores began a
  systematic elimination of the Fulvinis.  This was completed in 2475 when
  the Cornuti family usurped control of Miragliano.

  Currently, there is a branch of the Cacciabores directing an attempt to
  eradicate the secret Khainite cult of L'Artiglio delle Tenebre.  These
  uncontrollable murderers have caused the Cacciabores some grief as their
  random killings have brought forth a public outcry against assassinations.
  Some of the Khainite victims included valuable members of the Cacciabores.
  Where this "secret war" leads, none can tell.

  In addition, the consolidation of power by the Cornuti's is causing some
  concern with the Cacciabores dell' Ombra.  The current Guildmaster is
  keeping an eye on all activities of the Cornuti family to ensure that the
  Cacciabores' business dealings remain unhindered.

  Naturally, the identity of the Guildmaster is only known to his direct
  lieutenants.  Even the identities of those lieutenants are unknown to most
  of the members of the guild as the contacts between the upper echelon and
  the rest of the Guild are though "blinds".  "Blinds" are contacts that do
  not visually make direct contact, but communicate with closed doors, high
  walls, or with some other obstruction between them.  Moreover, there is
  (at least) one person in each household of the Grassi who gathers
  information for the Cacciabores.

  See 15-NPCs to read more about some of the guild's members.

  In almost all revenge killings performed by the Cacciabores dell' Ombra
  it is usual to send an anonymous wreath with the simple message "WITH
  REGRETS" upon it, unless the client states otherwise (and pays for the
  special treatment). This is perfectly okay as the Cacciabores only take
  up contracts upon specifically named people.  They would never betray a
  client. Orders like "Kill the guy who paid you to kill my father" are
  rejected in order to establish some kind of professional honour.

7       Cults, Worship & Magick
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

7.1     Worshipping in Miragliano
---------------------------------

Miragliano's citizens follow most of the same deities as the Empire with a
few exceptions.  Although the priorities are different this similarity owes
its existence to the historical roots that both nations share.  So let's
take a quick look at the differences.

First of all, Sigmar Heldenhammer is not worshipped as a god in Miragliano.
He is known as the man who unified The Empire and became the first Emperor
but no Tilean would ever give him the title of 'god'.  There have been
several attempts by immigrants who came originally from somewhere in the
Empire to establish various temples to Sigmar in the Tilean city, but all
those buildings have other functions today.  There could very well be small
semi-private shrines maitained by a few of the city's newer citizens but
Sigmar, generally, is not viewed in any special way by the public.

The second large difference is that some of the gods worshipped in the
Empire have different names here: e.g. Madonna or Pater Grande (great father
or holy father).

Taal's wife Rhya is known only as Madonna of the Marshes to the Miragliano
people.  In this town, with its dependance upon the surrounding marshes she
is of far greater importance than in the Empire.  Meanwhile Ulric the God of
battle, wolves and winter is hardly worshipped at all, although he has a
medium-sized temple on an island near the palace area.  This is not so much
because of the mild winters and the lack of wolves (there are wolves in the
Marshes, see bestiary in this article), but because most of Miragliano's
people think that followers of Ulric are cruel, simple-minded and hard to
understand.  Most citizens who do cleave to Ulric are too proud and vain to
expose themselves to ridicule.

Miragliano's people are a sea-following race and this is why Manann has so
much influence in this town.  He is known as Pater Grande di Mare.

Also Handrich, God of Trade, is well known in Miragliano and a large temple
to Mercopio (Handrich's Tilean name) has been build upon the largest island
at the port side. It contains a huge chapel for the whole of the local
Merchants' Guild and thirteen smaller private chapels for each of
Miragliano's major merchant families.  To learn more about this deity and
its followers, check out the Marienburg article in the roleplaying magazine
White Dwarf (WD) #121 where Handrich is described in the same way as the
other Gods are in WFRP rulebook.

But by far the largest temple of all Gods is an ancient temple of Taal a few
miles outside the island area in the marshes.

- Madonna di Miragliano

  Reikspiel)

  name Mercopio])

7.2     Magick in Miragliano (and elsewhere)
--------------------------------------------

7.2.1   New Magickal Sources and Spells
-----

* "Leonardo's Compendium of Rare and Wonderous Magicks"

Leonardo was a keen researcher where magick was involved. He was always on
the lookout for spells that would e.g. ease the artists work. Not the
creative process itself, by no means, then it would no longer be art, but
the tedious preparations. This would leave more time in which to be
creative.

Upon leaving for Altdorf, Leonardo left many of his notes and sketches in
the library.  Some of these have been found, tested and sorted.

8       Taxes & Tributes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* Water Tax

Miragliano's water supply is regulated by private water traders.  Even the
city's Watch Stations and offices have to buy water from those traders. As
you can imagine, this is a very profitable business.  To let Miragliano
benefit from this and to control water trade a bit more, in 1936 IC, a
Water Tax was introduced.  At the moment the tax rate is at 10 percent for
selling water to the city itself and 17.5 percent for private water
business.  Therefore most water is offered to one of the seven city water
prospectors.

* Restoration Tribute

As you know, Miragliano is based upon hundreds of small island with hundreds
of small channels between them. There is even a large number of buildings
that don't rest upon solid ground but are built upon wooden piles in the
Miragliano bay.  Over the years wind, rain, salt, effluent and garbage has
been at work constantly eroding numerous constructions.  After several
tragic accidents the Dieci decided in 1731 to create a special engineer and
repair force. To finance such teams (popularly called 'Pillar Monkeys') a
Restoration Tribute was introduced.  Any living inhabitant of Miragliano
must pay 5 Ducati per annum or loose his citizen's rights.  You may pay this
tribute for several years in advance if you want and there is not really a
firm date to pay it except that you have to pay it every year once.

- Bridge Taxes
- Trade Taxes (although trade is evident for Miragliano, the city doesn't
  tax everything in this case. This attracts lots of merchants)

* Channel Patrol Tax

Where other cities lie upon firm ground and are undermined by sewer systems,
Miragliano is built upon islands with hundreds of small channels running
through the city.  Where other cities maintain a sewer watch, Miragliano has
Channel Patrolmen with gondolas and rowing-boats.

The Channel Watch was established in 1623, when a secret plot against the
Duce was detected accidently by some loyal gondolieres.  At first this small
watch was privately financed by the Duce himself but over the centuries this
'tradition' became more and more unusual.  Nowadays the watch is partly
financed by the city's tradesmen who - unofficially - pay one third of the
watch's bills.  Another third is financed from the tax and the Duce pays the
rest.  The tax itself has to be paid by the gondolieres who add it to their
prices for their clients.

* Marsh Tribute

This is just one of those sources of income that the city fathers
established to finance their unbelievably high costs.  It is perhaps the
oldest of Miragliano's taxes and it is an old tradition to celebrate the
yearly fixing of its rate as "the Tribute to Mother Earth".

9       Law & Criminals
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

9.1     Law in Miragliano
-------------------------

Apart from the city's normal laws there are some peculiarities to the local
jurisprudence which can only be explained by Miragliano's special historical
or geographical background. Most of the laws have their roots in the needs
and moods of this Tilean city state :

* land owning law

Ground is a very rare commodity in Miragliano.  To restrict the access to
Miragliano's islands (mainly to avoid foreign merchants purchasing land)
and to protect its own interests (ie. those of Miragliano's eldest and
richest families) the Dieci passed a law in 1812 claiming each island and
every scrap of ground within a radius of 25 miles as Miragliano property and
denying any civil or personal right to own land.

Of course they were afraid of the citizen's response to this new law and so
they decided to allow each current landowner to keep his plot of ground
until he died, but the deceased's family would no longer inherit it.

Each year more and more land fell back to the city but the risk of extreme
public outcry (i.e. rioting) was eleminated.

In 1826 a new land owning law came into being.  In this law, the right to
own land was reinstated but with several restrictions :

1. A person who wants to own land is only allowed to do so, if he can prove
   that his family had lived in Miragliano continuously for at least 99
   years.
2. Only the city itself (via its administration) can sell any land or
   ground.
3. If a land owner commits a crime for which he would be imprisoned for at
   least 6 months (but no longer than 12) he may decide to make a conveyance
   of his land and leave the town for at least 5 years instead of being
   imprisoned.  If the penalty is more than one year the ground auto-
   matically falls back to Miragliano.
4. The Dieci have to agree each ground sale by a simple majority.
5. When a land-owning person dies, the land cannot be given to his
   descendants.  But they have the option to buy it again from the city
   before any others can get a chance to do so.

Of course, practice shows that if a family is as wealty enough to own some
ground then they usually know some way to commit a crime and get away with
it without losing land.

* water law

Water is another very important commodity in Miragliano.  Drinking the water
from the Tilean Sea or the surrounding marshes runs the risk of catching
some lethal disease and spoiled water has more than once caused an outbreak
of plague.  This is the reason why Water traders deliver drinkable water
with boats from the mountain rivers in the far north of Tilea.  It is not
surprising that several laws deal with this problem.

  + It is prohibited to sell water without having a license to do so.
  + Poisoning or tainting drinkable water will be punished with death
    by drowning.
  + In case of need, water may be rationed as it seems fit.
    Hoarding water during a time of rationing will be punished with death by
    starvation.
  + Each inhabitant of Miragliano has to collect rain water in barrels
    whenever possible.  Families are allowed to do so as one party.
  + People who steal water from others will be sentenced to prison
    (a minimum of 5 years) or death by strangulation in severe cases.
  + Usury (while selling water) noticed by the city's water prospectors
    causes the trader to loose his license and, depending on the merits of
    the case, either whipped publicly or sent to jail for six month.

There are several other regulations but these are the most important ones.

* criminal rehabilitation efficiency law

The official purpose of this law was to help and support the local trade and
industry.  It allows free citizens of Miragliano to "borrow" an already
covicted criminal as and unskilled labourer.  The criminal's punishment
must not be death or deportment and he has to be still in jail.  It is not
allowed to choose the criminal you want to "borrow" but this really depends
on your relationship to the rehabilitation administrator.  If one wishes to
"borrow" a criminal, he has to pay a small fee of 12 ducats and has to
return him after a week.  To encounter the risk of a criminal's death the
renter has to pay a fine of 500 ducats in the case of a "rehabilitated"
criminal becoming dead during the time of lending.

Lately it more often happens that local businessmen pay the Death Fine at
the same time they fetch the criminal.

* law to prevent the risk of catching diseases

In a city like Miragliano with its hostile surroundings the occurance of
diseases is something not too unusual.  Historically, waves of plagues have
swept over the city and severely cut back the populace.  Having learned from
this, the government has built a plague camp outside the city and
established this law.  You can read more details on this under 3.5 - The
Pitiful.

9.2     Criminals in Miragliano

10      Festive days
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-carnival
-Holy day of the Madonna de Miragliano

* Week of the Marshes

    'it is better to pay tribute to the marshes than to become part
     of them'.
                                                (Miragliano saying)

During one week of the year Miragliano's citizens celebrate the "Tribute to
Mother Earth".  Actually the week begins with the official fixing of the
Marsh tribute rate for the following year.  It is an unwritten law that for
the week after the procalamation, eating or drinking anything which did not
coming initially from or out of the earth is forbidden, for example meat,
fish or any alcohol except wine is forbidden.  There are a few merciful
exceptions from that rule - the sick and the condemed are exempt.

Persons who break this rule normally have to pay a donation to the local
shrine of Rhya who is worshipped as the Madonna of the Marshes.  But those
who blatantly transgress may be force-fed with (usually foul) vegetables
from one of Miragliano's few market places.

Despite the restrictions, the Week of the Marshes is an incident for the
Tileans to celebrate.  Mainly in the evening hours large and frolicsome
feasts abound and because most alcoholic drinks are proscribed other
pleasures and amusements are found.

11      Relationships with other City States
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- Miragliano was for a long time and still is a rival of Remas.
  (from rivalry in their trade relations with Araby to open hostility and
   war between them often soliciting the aid of various other small Tilean
   City States)

- kind of semi-private arrangement of the Cornuti clan with Sartosa's
  leading pirate groups

- lots of (semi-)private relationships between influential families in
  several northern City States.

12      Inner & Outer Enemies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- Estalia

- some Arabian tribes are hostile but others are friendly and trade
  goods with Tilea

- Skaven
  The existance of a Skaven captiol is not widespread knowledge among
  Miragliano's inhabitants. Naturally they well realise that some sort
  of large Skaven nest exists within the marsh or that the Skaven generally
  make their home there - in fact they may well believe that the Skaven are
  marsh-dwelling creatures instead of the civilised, tunnel-dwelling race
  that they actually are.

13      Careers, Skills & Creatures in Miragliano and the Marshes
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

13.1	Generating Characters born in Miragliano
------------------------------------------------

Miragliano is a place unusually plagued with disease - the proximity of the
marshes, poor water supply, and a warpstone meteor festering in the bay.
Therefore each (N)PC born and raised in Miragliano has a 10% chance of
getting the Immunity To Disease skill as initial skill - additionally to
those listed in the WFRP rulebook.

But while the chances to resist the effects of disease are higher in this
city, the chances to get in touch with warpstone-contaminated water are
higher, too. Give every NPC (optionally, you may want to use this rule for
player characters, too) born and raised in Miragliano a 5% chance of being
contaminated. Contaminated characters are born having slight mutations or
develop one of these mutations when being a child.

Use your imagination to invent some mutations. For example, a character
is born as a normal child with the skin of the left flat of the hand being
ash-grey. Or a character can develop a second thoothless mouth on his lower
back (no tongue in it).

13.3    Creatures in Miragliano & the Marshes
---------------------------------------------

* Slagworm

  This creature is a seven to nine yards long worm which lives in tunnels
  down under the surface of the marshes.  It feeds itself by eating earth
  and small animals and produces a large amount of excrement.  Slagworms
  live in tunnels up to six feet under the marsh surface, but come out to
  wiggle upon the surface on particularly dark and cold nights. They
  don't have eyes or ears but they can smell their prey and also feel the
  vibrations of the earth when their prey moves. They excrete a non-smelling
  brown slime when eating or moving which contains enough acid to destroy
  even normal metal, but not gold or Gromril.  On the surface they are
  incredibly fast and agile.  Their underground movement depends on where
  their self-eaten tunnels are going to. If they have to 'eat' new tunnels
  they will be possibly well fed before reaching their target.

  Alignment : Neutral

  Psychological Traits: Slagworms are subject to fear of great heat
   like large fires.  They cause fear in living creatures unter 6 feet
   tall, and phobia against all kind of worms is a common disorder
   among those suffering from Insanity. Any character with this
   disorder who encounters a slagworm will be subject to terror.

  Special Rules: Slagworms attack via Bite attacks. Because it has a
   mouth full of barbed teeth each successful attack causes 1d6+1
   wounds. It always tries to devour its prey so its body full of acid
   only counts if it is attacked from any side other than frontal. If
   the slagworm has been successfully attacked or touched, the acid
   causes d6 wound regardless of any armour except Gromril or golden
   armour if the character has been hit by the acid (33% chance of being
   hit). Normal metal will be fully destroyed in d3 rounds if a Risk test
   has been failed.

* Marsh Wolf

  The winters are mild in the Miragliano area and a steady wind from the
  Tilean Sea brings salty but fresh air to the marshes.  The whole area has
  only small places of woodlands in it.  Although this is not a perfect
  environment for wolves, a few packs of these animals do live here - the
  Marsh Wolves.  Probably originally from the moutains to the north, they
  found a place to live in the marsh.  Why they choose to live in this
  barren area is a mystery but they are a dangerous enemy to the lone
  individual or a small groups of travellers.  Those uncautious enough to
  travel without guards through the Marshes are almost inviting an attack.

  Living in this area the marsh wolves have adapted to their new environ-
  ment.  Their short and dark brown fur is full of dirt as constant grooming
  is pointless in a place where you can't help but get dirty.  They are
  thought to feed off the corpses of all those who have found eternal rest
  in the Marshes.  It is only because those that die are escaped criminals,
  slaves or the poorest of the poor that no expedition funded by the clerics
  of Morr has been mounted to catch, drive away or kill these animals.

  Alignment : Evil

  Psychological Traits : Marsh Wolves are subject to fear of Magick.

  Special Rules : Marsh Wolves do have a well developed sense for
     Magick. This is a natural ability and they don't count as
     magickal themselves. The roaring of a Marsh Wolf may induce
     fear within 20 yards in all those with Cl 33 or less.

  Movement : Because the Marshes are their natural environment
     they learned how to move in it. Mud and hills don't count
     as difficult ground for them.

                  -------------------------------------

* Sea Hydra

  The Sea Hydra is a creature of Chaos. Like the normal Hydra it has
  multiple heads, typically three or four.  Sea Hydrae are rare 'guests'
  in the northern Tilean Sea, but occasionally they wander up from the
  coasts of Araby.  Smaller ones may have also the ability to fly short
  distances and are lethal encounters for a human or elf. Larger ones
  cannot fly anymore (thank Mannan!) but when they attack small ships the
  worst nightmares become true.

  Overall, Sea Hydrae look like huge snakes with multiple upper bodies
  and two large wings which shrink as the beast gets older.

  In combat, each head has one bite attack per round but the hydra doesn't
  have feet or claws, and so it is not able to move on land.

  Physique : The body of Sea Hydrae is a mixture of a reptilian body and
  a serpent-like one. They are usually between 15 and 60 feet in length.

  Alignment : Chaotic.

  Psychological Traits : Sea Hydrae cause fear in living creatures which
  are 5 feet smaller than theyself.

  Special Rules : All Sea Hydrae have Night Vision to a range of 50 yards.

  Notes : The youger the Sea Hydra the smaller it is. The smaller it is
  the higher is the possibility that it can fly.  No one has ever seen a
  Sea Hydra flying which has been longer than 25 yards.  But it isn't
  really clear if these beasts are flightless.  It may just be that no one
  has survived a meeting with a 75 foot long flying hydra!

* Cabuti-Fly

  The Cabuit-fly is a finger-nail sized flying insect that lives in the marsh
  lands around Miragliano and probably elsewhere as well.  It emits a low,
  buzzing sound when flying that is accompanied by a loud clicking when angry.
  The clicking sound is used to attract other nearby Cabuti-flys to come to
  its aid.  It has a long sting that it uses defensively - Cabuti-flys fly off
  after stinging a victim.  They are known to spread disease.

  If attacked or annoyed the Cabuti-fly will begin to click and will attract
  D6 other flys which arrive together after D3-1 rounds - a zero roll means
  they turn up at the start of the next round.  A successful listen test (Soft
  noise) is required to detect the direction one new fly will appear from -
  otherwise the victim can't anticipate their first attack.

  Only one person may attack a Cabuti-fly at any one time and swords and other
  hand weapons are NOT the best way to deal with them - use a cloak and swat
  those buggers.  Missile weapons, unless you have Marksmanship and a GM who
  appreciates style over realism, are out of the question.  The Cabuti-fly may
  Dodge Blow every attack - even missiles.  If the attacker is using something
  to swat the fly then apply a modifier depending on what is being used.

  Attacks ignore armour as the fly is so close to the target that it can and
  will choose a warm, moist area of exposed flesh to sting.  Attacks never
  cause a wound - a successful sting from a Cabuti-fly injects a strong
  irritant into the victim who must make a Cl check every round from now on to
  ignore the pain.  Once the victim is stung, the Cabuti-fly flys off.
  Irritation wears off after D20 minutes but the area around the puncture-
  wound swells up and is sore to the touch for D4 days.

  Cabuti-flys carry disease.  A disease test is necessary if stung.  This is
  just to avert a mild fever but it may be a more virulent type - GMs choice.

  [Author's Note: Please remember Miragliano's Law to Prevent the Risk of
                  Catching Disease. Any person with a large and obviously sore
                  insect bite on their person will be arrested and forcibly
                  given a medical examination to make sure it is just an
                  insect bite.]

* Tilean Manhounds

  Tilean Manhounds are a breed of War Dog much prized for their looks.  They
  are waist high on a man and have sleek grey coats.  Bred for obedience and
  speed - they may be considered able to catch up with any other creature that
  has a move of 6 or less.  Their obedience is backed up with fantastic
  loyalty; when an owner dies quite often the dogs have to be destroyed as
  well since they steadfastly refuse to obey anyone else.  All Manhounds are
  grey.  Other colours do appear in litters from time to time but these are
  routinely destroyed to keep the pedigree pure.

  They will obey their master unquestionably most of the time but if the
  situation warrants it, then test against the owner's or the dog's Leadership
  - whichever is highest.  Of course, these qualities have not been enhanced
  without cost - Tilean Hounds have a lower Wounds value than the normal, but
  less controllable War Dogs.

  [If you want to let a PC own a Manhound then I suggest you give the dog D6
  commands that it will always obey (ask the PC to write them down).  If the
  PC wants the dog to do something not covered by the commands then make the
  dog take an Int check.]

14      Other Miragliano Secrets and Mysteries
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

* The lion mask of integrity
  The temple of Solkan, a small building on an island near the palace
  island.  It isn't very well attended in Miragliano and followers of Solkan
  are not anybody's darling.  Apart from this the temple plays an important
  role when answers to difficult public questions have to be found.

  In times of never-ending debates with no solutions in sight, it is usual
  to let Solkan himself decide who's right and who's not.  Each party with a
  different opinion in the controversy chooses one person who has to lay his
  right hand into the mouth of a huge stone mask of a lion's head hanging on
  the inner side of the eastern wall of the temple.  Leaving his hand where
  it is the person has to state his grievance and wait for a decision.   The
  legend tells that Solkan himself decides whether this person is right or
  wrong.  If someone is lying or unworthy of trust or has broken the law,
  Solkan will let the lion bite off the person's hand, thus making his
  decision clear.

  There are reported cases when Solkan has removed the hands of each repre-
  sentative.  In such cases it is said that Solkan was unwilling to be
  disturbed by mortals.

  To avoid the annoying the god it was decided to only use this method of
  making decisions as a last recourse and only upon issues of the utmost
  importance.  The Duce is the only one who is can allow the high priest of
  Solkan to execute such a ceremony.

  If the high priest - Fredo Pommorigione at the moment - decides to disturb
  his god, the ceremony begins with a three day long sacrificing of flowers
  and meal.  The climax is the execution of two convicted criminals.
  Afterwards the ceremony continues as described above.

  GM Note: Please do not read this paragraph if you don't want to use the
           lion mask as GM.  Otherwise, you will now be introduced to one of
           the most dangerous secrets in Miragliano.  The mask itself does
           not have any supernatural capabilities.  It is just a mask made
           of stone.  During the ceremony it is always kind of semi-dark in
           the temple and the air is smoky to produce a atmosphere which
           impresses people.  Behind the mask is a small chamber.  Anybody
           who puts his hand into the lion's mouth normally would notice
           that it is blocked by a stone.  During the ceremony placing a
           hand into the mouth will lead to sticking his hand into a pot of
           warm gelatine which has some kind of anaesthetic effect.
           He will feel that its warm, soft and glibbering. After a short
	   while, the person cannot feel his hand anymore. This effect will
	   last for at least d6 turns after the hand (or the arm stub) has
	   been withdrawn from the lion mouth.
           The chamber itself is absolutely dark and in it one
           of the higher priests will sit holding an incredibly sharp blade.
           If he wants to expose the person as a liar he cuts the hand off
           and quickly replaces the pot with the gelatine.
           There are only three persons who know the secret of this mask,
           the Miragliano high priest of Solkan and two Level 3 Clerics
           of Solkan of this temple. How do you become member of this club?
           That's easy: Become a cleric of Solkan, stay all your life in
           Miragliano and its temple and advance to Level 3 (at least).
           Then wait (actively or passively) for the death of one of the
           three persons knowing about it. Of course, you have to be a
           real and exemplary follower of Solkan.
           Another note: Not even the Duce knows of this secret.

* The forgotten catacombs

  When the first settlers built a city calles Giamirado in -500 IC they were
  scared of being hunted down by other tribes. So they decided to build a
  part of the city under the surface to hide themselves when neccessary.
  Most of this ancient underground city has been forgotten about over the
  centuries and has become blocked by flood or subsidence.  All original
  entry-points have been walled over.

15      Some interesting places
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

15.1	The Miragliano Academy of Finer Arts
--------------------------------------------

This, the most renowned of all art academies, was founded in the year 1756.
It's founder was The Royal Portrait Painter of Miragliano (the city was then
a duchy) Alfonse della Couture.  The Academy was originally intended as a
museum where the people would be able to view the portraits of the royal
family.  However after the revolution in 1812 IC, the role of the Academy
was redefined.

It was now to be both a museum as well as an institution of learning.  The
academy attracted many of the great scholars of its time and has remained
the leader in devising new techniques of painting.  There is even a branch
within the academy researching the possibilities of combining magick with
painting.  The most successful application so far has been with illusion-
ists, but more of that later.

The Academy has become, over the years, a very patriarchial institution.  In
the beginning it had one prefect and several teachers, the prefect was in
charge of running both the museum and the art school.

Being appointed as a professor of the Academy in those days was considered
a great honour, nowadays several other schools of painting have sprung up to
rival the academy, so the title of professor is not as respected as it used
to be.  None of the new schools yet surpass the old Academy, either in size
or skill.

The Academy teaches several branches of what is considered to be the Finer
Arts; Art and Rhetoric are among these, there is also a small department for
Magickal appliances that has been recently established.

15.1.1  Description Of The Academy
------

The academy is housed in a very old building.  The buillding dates back to
1685 IC when the Duke decided he needed a building for representational
purposes (in fact, he needed an institution to exercise an influence on the
arts and the artists). The building is huge, and very elaborate, with gargoyles
and columns on the magnificent facade that fronts the entrance.  The walls are
painted a dark yellow with white window frames and columns.  It is 3 stories
high.  Most of the rooms and lecture halls of the academy have very high
ceilings and large windows that makes for excellently well-lit workshops.
The entry hall has marble floors, as does the staircase and at first glance
the academy looks in admirably good shape, but on the inside it is quite
different.

The back rooms and the courtyard around which the academy is built no longer
looks so good.  They have been stripped of valubles to keep the academy
going.  The funding from the Dieci has grown smaller every year, and the
academy is now struggling to keep things going.

Both Claudia and Hugo suspect Erich of siphoning off money to keep his old
life style (moved the description of these NPCs to section 16).  This is not
the case however.

The building houses the museum, (Musee della Pittura Royale?), on the ground
floor, and the Academy on the first and second floors.

15.1.2  The Staff At The Academy
------

The Academy houses Teachers, Professors and Researchers. Most Professors
double up as reserchers, they are obliged to.

The Academy currently has 15 seats on the Board. The Board consists of all
teaching staff, those employed at the museum, and the prefect.  The Board
decides and amends the curriculum of the different classes.  Also the
finances of the Museum and the Academy resides with the Board.  Voting on
the Board is done by simple majority rules.

See section 16-NPCs for the description of the Academies' prefect and three
of its professors.

15.1.3  The Pupils At The Academy
------

The pupils that attend the academy often come from the higher classes, those
with nothing to do.  However, there are scholarships provided both by the
Academy and local patrons of the arts.  The students from the Academy are
generally considered superior in their artistic developments than other art
students in the city.

The Academy has a total of 60 students from all over the Old World, there's
two from Norsca, five from Albion and even from Araby there are two
students.

15.1.4  The Miragliano Museum Of Royal Art
------

Despite its new role the museum has retained its name.  After the revolution
the first Dieci could not decide on a new name and so the old one was kept.
The joke was that from now on the art work would be royal in quality, but
not in motif.

The most visited exhibition of all time was when Leonardo displayed his
painting "The Last Breakfast", and other works.  Other noted exhibitors
have included;

Rostini (sculptures), Pelangano (paintings), and Andreanos (pottery) from
Hellene.  These four artists are considered to be the most influential of
all artists in Old World.

The museum has two people employed full time, one to collect entry fees,
and the other a guard to ensure that visitors behave.  Occasionally the
professors at the Academy will lead a guided tour of the museum.

15.1.5  Skills taught at the academy
------

The Finer Arts :
        o  Calligraphy              o  Carving
        o  Engraving                o  Painting
        o  Pottery                  o  Sculpting

(We divided the art skill into sub skills, as we think the Art skill to be too
 comprehensive to be taught as one single skill.)

If a charakter knows one Art skill, and want to learn another one, the skill
cost is reduced to 75 experience points for further purchases of those skills.

In addition the academy has its own 'Department of Languages' teaching
the following dialects: Breton, Reikspiel, Tilean, Kislev and Albion.
Also, rhetoric is taught here, as well as many obscure languages:

	o Classical - Tilean        o Classical - Hellenic
        o Fan-Eltharin (Wood Elves) o Keltic (only a few phrases, no alphabet)
        o Khazalid (Dwarfish only)  o Midean (ancient, border Princes)

15.1.6  Plots and Intrigues at the Academy
------

Summary :

Ever since Erich was chosen as Prefect instead of Hugo, Hugo has been
nursing thoughts of revenge.  Hugo has, in the past months, been slipping
arsenic into drinks which he gives to Erich, and the accumulation of poison
is beginning to show.  Erich is having difficulty concentrating, and has to
rest frequently.

Claudia believes that Erich has his hand deep in the till, siphoning of
Academy funds for his own purposes.  She believes that she could do a much
better job.

Giulio loves everybody and would never dream of hurting anyone as long as
they visit his paint-shop.

Adventure Hooks :
-----------------

- Erich has somehow found out what Hugo is doing and want the PCs to help
  him;

- Hugo wants the PCs to help him get rid of Erich (He will of course not
  tell them that he is the one who is poisonong Erich);

- Giulio hires the PCs to pose for his students;

- Claudia hires the students to help her prove that Erich is taking Academy
  money (if necessary she will forge evidence to get the office of Prefect).


15.2	The Feranti Kennels
---------------------------

Amongst the nobility of Tilea it is considered proper to own a few hunting
dogs.  The favoured breeds are Tilean Manhounds or Lacoste Spaniels, and in
Miragliano there is one main breeder - Dom Padotte Feranti.  A Feranti or a
Feranti Lacoste is the sign of some wealth as the pedigree is recognised
throughout Tilea and Estalia, and is not unknown even in the Border Princes.
The Feranti Kennels lie just upon a small island at the northeastern outskirts
and on a
of the city and on a quiet day you can hear the dogs barking from the city
gates.

The current Dom Feranti is the fourth to run the Kennels.  Padotte's Great-
Grandfather founded them in 2447 and bred War Dogs for various mercenary and
state companies.  Since then, the Tilean Manhound has become well estab-
lished across Tilea and the rest of the Southern Old World.  The Ferantii
have gained a certain reputation for producing particularly obedient dogs.
In 2497, Padotte's father (under the watchful eye of his own father) intro-
duced the Lacoste Spaniel - a more frivolous, domestic type of dog that has
a smooth, silky coat and is popular as a household pet (again, only amongst
the upper-classes).  Feranti fortunes have increased steadily over the
years and the Feranti's are minor, but well known, members of the Grassi -
they also own several Insulae throughout the city.

  Costs to purchase a hound:
  Tilean Manhound (pure bred, documented pedigree)    : 10-60 Db
  Lacoste Spaniel (pure bred, documented pedigree)    : 6-25  Db

See also Padotte Feranti's brief history and description in the NPC section
of this book.

ERICH VON SCHNOEDE              Prefect of the Academy of Finer Arts
                                Artisan-Artist, ex-Artisan Apprentice-Artist,
                                ex-Student

Appearance   : Immaculate, well dressed, elderly man.

Personality  : Educated, professional, corteous.

Insanity     : Slightly Paranoid.

Motivations  : Running the Academy without trouble.

Catchphrases : "No running in the corridors!"

Possessions  : Fine clothes, small stiletto hidden in left sleeve.

Background   : Erich was born in Nuln, to a wealthy family. He is used to
being surrounded by wealth, so when his father's merchant empire disinte-
grated, he actually had to work to stay alive!  Through his fathers former
contacts he managed to sneak into the postion of Prefect at the academy, in
front of Hugo von Brochman, the aspiring prefect, who was degraded to
professor. Von Brochman never got over this and has sworn to be avenged.

Social Standing: Wealthy people are sorry for him when talking to him,
but won't offer him help.  People of low standing don't like him for the way
he muscled-in to the top position at the Academy.  Those of Miragliano
consider the Academy a symbol of the revolution.  Never has a non-citizen
been a prefect.  The idea of von Brochman was bad enough, but to have von
Schnoede is worse...

Attitudes    : When young he despised people who had to work for a living,
now he has to work himself.  He is an angry old man, attempting to offload
as much work onto his secretary as possible.  Representing the Academy to
during feasts, exhibitions and other social events is fine, but it reminds
him too much of the old days.  He has retained most of his attitude towards
the lower castes, and envies the higher ones from whence he came.

GIULIO ANDREOTTI                professor at the Academy of Finer Arts

                                ex-Scribe

Appearance   : Middle aged, slim, full black beard.

Personality  : Cheerful, bustling, always busy.

Motivations  : Educate the students, and to introduce painting to as many
               people as possible (he does own a paintshop).

Catchphrases : "Have you been to the 'Brush and Quill'? A marvellous place
                if I may say so!", "Not enough RED, you twit, more red!"

Possessions  : Ordinary clothes, expensive clock.

Background   : Giulio comes from a poor family, he was born in Miragliano,
and so is the locals favourite to the office of prefect, but since the
prefect has become an office appointed by the Dieci, they have little hope.
Giulio started out as a scribe at 16.  He had been taught to write by his
old neighbour, and had aspirations to become a book binder just like him.
He discovered and developed his artistic abilities through illumination of
his written work, and became quite popular among the lower castes. He would
often write documents for would-be merchants, who then went broke, unable
to pay him.  After a particularly devastating bankruptcy, Giulio was unable
to pay his own bills, and had to sell his writing equipment to be able to
pay.  This left him without much, so he decided to embark upon a new career
that of the artist. He applied to the Academy and was accepted.  He has
since spent most of his time here learning and laterly also teaching.  He
was able to open his own paint shop, and hire a part time clerk with extra
money from a very satisfied customer who was high up in the merchant class.

Social Standing: Giulio is liked by almost everybody (Erich is the
exception, but then, he doesn't like anybody).  Aspiring students look up to
him, the locals know him and he is well liked. He is getting more jobs from
the established merchants in the city, and he is carving out a well-deserved
reputation for excellent work.

Attitudes    : He is not too friendly towards merchants due to his many
unfortunate encounters in his youth, but he has become adept at hiding his
discontent when in their presence, especially since they have begun offering
him lucrative jobs.

had an illicit affair with one of the professors at the University, and she
left to save them both from the shame of being discovered.  She is not
particularly good at painting, and is only just good enough to be accepted
at the Academy.  Despite her talents in languages, she insists on speaking
Tilean with a horrible Bretonnian accent (she speaks both fluently). Perhaps
she wants to hide her past, or could there be something else...?
One secret she does hide is that she knows Leonardo is back in town.  She
recieves private painting lessons, in return for which she does his shopping
and errands (He dare not go out lest he be recognized).

Social Standing: The male student populace are very attentive when she
lectures on the "Qualities of correct mixing in the colour spectrum"
(see FEL).  Her classes also are very popular.  Claudia enjoys this
popularity, it is something she didn't have in Altdorf, she would go to
lenghts to keep it...

Attitudes    : Not very friendly towards Erich, VERY friendly with Giulio,
Generally pleasant to everybody else, slightly arrogant toward the poor.

HUGO VON BROCHMANN              professor at The Academy of Finer Arts
                                Artisan-Artist, ex-Artisan Apprentice-Artist,
                                ex-Physicians Apprentice

Appearance   : Athletic, piercing blue eyes, fair hair.

Personality  : Humorous, observant, charming, practical.

Insanity     : Megalomania.

Motivations  : Get rid of Erich, and take his place.

Catchphrases : "How are you today?"
               "You certainly look much better than yesterday."

Possessions  : Ordinary clothes, glasses.

Background   : Hugo comes from a wealthy background in Talabec.  He begun to
study medecine, under a Physician.  The apprenticeship did not work out well
though.  Hugo despised being forced to do menial tasks for his mentor, 'I'm
better than this, I don't deserve this!'.  Hugo ended his apprentice-ship
with a farewell dinner, which his mentor did not survive.  Hugo disappeared
the same evening and fled to Miragliano, where he began to study the arts
instead.

Social Standing: Hugo is regarded as a friendly person, but not an essential
friend for those who wish to climb.  Rather his behaviour is assessed as
slightly eccentric at times, when he is overly friendly, trying to please
everybody.  Hugo has a very complicated personality, he distrusts most
people, but has discovered that he can't get where he wants without them.
Therfore the need for his act.

Attitudes    : Almost overly friendly towards everybody, including Erich.
He inwardly despises Erich for taking his place, and has been routinely
poisoning his morning coffee (yes it has been discovered), with arsenic.
As a consequence Erich is getting sicker by the day. Hugo believes it is
only a matter of weeks before the office of prefect will be his.

LEONARDO de MIRAGLIANO          famous artist and inventor
                                Scholar, ex-Inventor, ex-Inventors'
                                Apprentice,
                                ex-Student, ex-Artisan-Painter,
                                ex-Artisans Apprentice-Painter

Psychology : He is noted for his lack of conscience when it comes to
finishing his works.

Posessions : He owns a town house in Miragliano.

His Story  : Leonardo was born in Miragliano in 2487.  His father was a
prospering merchant and his mother one of the serving maids of the house.
Apparently the wife of Leonardo's father was barren, the result of this was
that Leonardo was taken in and raised as a true son of the family.  As an
only child Leonardo was left much to his own devices.  Reading took a pre-
dominant amount of his time, and entering his teens Leonardo discovered
painting, and his seemingly unnatural talent for it.  On reaching sixteen
Leonardo was admitted to the famous Art Academy in Miragliano.  His mentor
was clearly surprised at young Leonardo's skill with the brush.  At eighteen
Leonardo had learned all the master knew, and as a graduation present the
master let him contribute to a wall painting in the Dieci chambers. Leonardo
painted with such skill that his contribution outshone that of his master,
who swore never to paint again.  While Leonardo went to the academy, his
father went bankrupt.  He had been accused of using clipped weights on his
scales.  He was later aquitted of this charge, but the damage had been done.

Rumour has it that his master still teaches at the academy but refuses even
to touch a paint brush.  Throughout his two years of training at the academy
Leonardo never gave up his interest in reading.  He believed himself to be a
fully trained painter, and that there was nothing more for him to learn in
that field of knowledge, but his intellect was still unsated so he travelled
to Altdorf, to become a student at the University of Aldorf, where the
largest of all libraries in the old world was to be found.  At least this is
the reason he gave to his friends.  There is, however, another reason.
During the last years at the academy, Leonardo discoverd a book in the
library basement.  Leonardo spent so much time in the library that in the
end he was given a "scholarship" in the form of a job in the library, since
his father was no longer able to pay for his tuition.  This book was well
hidden, and it was only by accident that he found it.

The book,"Phaeries and Othere Unworldlye Creaturaes", gave details about
some of the more dangerous creatures of magick and of the magick that
creates them.  Leonardo read the book and became interested in magick, if
only to counter that which the book described. Unfortunately, and
unknown to Leonardo, the book had an owner, the person who hid the book in
the library.  Leonardo recieved several anonymous letters, each delivering
dire threats if he did not return the book to where he found it.  However
nothing happened, so Leonardo did not return the book.  As the end of
Leonardo's education came nearer, several strange things happened.  First,
items went missing and appeared in Leonardo's room.  Fortunately he managed
to hide them before his room was "inspected" on the basis of an anonymous
tip.  Then the Professor of Acrylics tripped, and fell down the stairs.
Leonardo, who was close behind, was blamed for pushing him, by evil and
envious tongues.

Several other minor incidents occured for which Leonardo got the blame.
Upon graduation he thought he would be rid of these incidents as he firmly
believed his fellow students were responsible.  But the incidents continued,
they also increased in magnitude.  Leonardo was soon tired of trying to
explain the inexplicable and decided it was time for a change of scenery.
This was when he heard of the University of Altdorf, and decided to study
there.

On his way to Altdorf Leonardo was ambushed by a band of goblins. The attack
left him unconscious and seriously wounded, only through the aid of kind
travellers did he recover enough to reach his destination.  He later
developed an 'irrational' fear of goblins because of this incident, this
fear is one of the reasons for his unceasing reaserch into warmachines and
methods of killing - his wish to get even with the goblins.

Through his studies he became aquainted with Professor Gotthard Screiber,
notorious at the university for his unstoppable tinkering.  He was always
trying to improve things, usually without bothering to try and understand
the principles behind the machine he was working on, but this did not seem
to deter him.

Leonardo, however, was more thorough in his studies, always wanting to
understand everything, and only then trying to improve things.  After
finishing his studies, Leonardo set up his own laoratory with the aid of a
local noble, Adolphus Eberhardt van der Veer, who took a liking to the
young man with a brilliant mind.

Over the next years Leonardo invented and improved many of the machines in
use today at the Imperial Engineering School.  The strain on the not-so-
resourceful noble was considerable.  In the end, after a lot of strings had
been pulled, the "Imperial School of Engineering" was established with
Leonardo as its chief engineer.  Adolphus E. van der Veer became the
administrator, due to his "discovery" of Leonardo's talent.

Leonardo of Miragliano has invented many things, some are machines of
destruction used by the Imperial army others are less known items of culture
(often within the finer arts).  His most reknowned inventions in the Empire
are the Steamtank and the Warwagon, others are the glider used for air
reconnaisance before battles, a mortar launching bombs, and the dreaded
whirlwind.  The Whirlwind is a small cart pulled by a horse with a rider.
Two long poles extend from the cart along the sides of the horse and out in
front of it. On the tip of these poles is a wheel mounted horizontally on a
gear driven by turning of the wheels of the cart.  On the edges of the wheel
are mounted several scythes so that the cart can be driven into battle with
the spinning scythe wheel in front of it, clearing a path through the enemy
ranks.  The glider looks like a pair of wings. Percieving the idea of
aerodynamics Leonardo has managed to construct something similar in function
to the wings of a bird.  The glider has no means of power, all it can do is
glide down from a height.

He has created new designes for castles that are more resistant to the
new gunpowder weapons - thicker walls built at an angle.

Leonardo is also noted for his artistic abilities, he has decorated many
palaces, with his portraits and paintings of their owners.  He has even
designed the palace of the Duce Carbone (the tyrannical leader of
Miragliano's neighbouring city state). Carbone wanted a statue made of him-
self, the grandest in all Tilea, 12 meters high; Leonardo designed the
statue to be made of bronze and cast in one piece, an unheard of method when
first concieved.  It proved possible , but alas, the project was terminated
when Carbone needed the bronze to make cannons for his war fleet.
Leonardo's plans were never fulfilled.

The years flew past for Leonardo, the schools sponsors were interested in
warmachines to keep the enemies of the Empire at bay, and Leonardo happily
obliged them, inventing such wonders as the famous Steam Tank, and
producing the primary sketches for the War wagon.  As time passed Leonardo
began to feel the strain, and the ever increasing pressure from the admin-
istration.  He became tired of being pushed around and decided to stage
his own death during the inaugural test flight of a heavier than air flying
machine.  The machine apparently crashed on top of Leonardo, whereupon its
alcohol powered engine exploded, demolishing part of the Engineering school.
No trace was ever found of Leonardo, so everybody assumed he had been burned
to death in the explosion following the crash.  However, having prepared
himself in advance, Leonardo fled Altdorf immediately after the incident,
taking only his most treasured posessions with him.  Through his post of
Chief Engineer, Leonardo had saved enough money to set up a small laboratory
in his home town of Miragliano, to continue his experiments in his own time.
Only his closest friends and associates know of his return and that he
continues to follow his favourite pastime - the pursuit of knowledge.

Leonardo is becoming an old man, and with age comes the knowledge that no
man can know everyting. This has put him down, but still he continues his
search for knowledge, as well as his painting and designing.

Leonardo's most famous works :

Among his most famous work as a painter, is "The Last Breakfast" showing
Sigmar with his generals, before Sigmar leaves for the Worlds Edge Mountains
in 50IC.  He wrote the "Trattato della Pittura" describing the techniques of
the master painters, also an introductory chapter in painting and magicks.
Not only a painter, he designed both the War Wagons and the Steam Tanks of
the Imperial Army.  Also many ballistic weapons and some other self pro-
pelled vehicles, cranes, fortifications, etc...

His knowledge of magick helped him in many areas.

LUIGI CAMPANELLI                Guildmaster of the Cacciabores dell' Ombra
                                Assassin, ex-Pharmacist, ex-Charlatan, ex-
                                Spy

Campanelli struggled long and hard to become the Guildmaster back in 2504.
Since then, he has expanded the web of his network to ensure that the
Cacciabores' business continues to thrive.  Campanelli, himself, is a member
of a couple of other secret societies.  Obviously, his role in the Caccia-
bores is unknown to the other members who only know Campanelli as a success-
ful importer of rare and exotic spices.

Campanelli is a rather non-descript, average looking 48 year old.  He stands
at 5ft 8in, weighs 160 lbs., with greasy black hair and penetrating dark
brown eyes.  As expected for someone in his true occupation, Luigi is very
cool in most stressful situations.  Only very severe circumstances may cause
Luigi to lose his normally tight rein on his explosive temper.  Those who
cause such an outburst will usually meet a most violent death.

ANGELO TORRELINI                First Lieutenant in Assassin Guild
(alias Antonio Santini)         Assassin, ex-Mercenary, ex-Mercenary
                                Sergeant, ex-Bounty Hunter

Santini was once a member and leader of the infamous Tilean Condottieri unit
called the Black Company (Compagnia Nera).  Unlike other Condottieri units
who postured more than they fought battles, the Black Company preferred to
engage in battle and would do so even if it ran counter to the orders of
their overall Commander.  The Black Company would even commit atrocities
against villagers who supplied and aided their enemies (at least, far more
terrible atrocities than was the norm).  The gruesome sack (more like
slaughter) of the village of Piccolo Asilo in 2499 by the Black Company was
the last straw.  Several Tilean city-states (including Miragliano) sent
companies of Condottieri out to defeat the Black Company and execute its
leaders.

Santini realized that the Black Company would be overwhelmed if engaged in
battle.  He and other leaders ordered their men to disperse and went into
hiding.  Most of the Black Company were found and executed in the following
weeks, but Santini escaped to the Empire.  There he stayed for four years,
assumed the name Angelo Torrelini (so his many enemies could not find him)
and worked as a Bounty Hunter.

Needing some muscle to unseat the current Guildmaster, Campanelli (who knew
the Bounty Hunter's past) invited Torrelini to join him in Miragliano to
discuss business.  Both reached a mutual agreement and succeeded in removing
the incumbent Guildmaster.  Campanelli then made Torrelini his first lieu-
tenant, chief enforcer, and designated successor.  Since that time, Torre-
lini has become an Assassin in his own right.

Angelo Torrelini is as emotionless an individual as one could find in Tilea.
His coldly intense blue eyes are said to be able to stop a charging dog in
its tracks.  With his black hair, sculptured face and imposing size (6ft
3in, 210 lbs), Torrelini is a frightening man.  In his 38 years, Torrelini
has seen many things that would give others pause.  He is so mechanically
efficient that he can "off" a business rival as soon as look at him.

To the outside world, Torrelini is a minor partner to the Campanelli family
business, as well as other businesses (especially the Roselli Funeral Home
and Burial Services).  Even more surprising, Torrelini is an unlikely patron
of the arts and operas.  Moreover, Torrelini is a member of the Preservers
Lodge and their contact to the Cacciabores.  Not only do the fools have no
clue of Torrelini's true association with the Cacciabores, but they don't
realize that he maintains complete dossiers on each one of them.

MARCO VIDELLI			Targeteer, ex-Mulatore (Hunter), ex-Herdsman

Appearance   : Fit and supple, round face with quizzical smile, black hair.
Personality  : Quietly amused at the world.  Loyal.
Motivations  : Petition the Duce on behalf of the Maldisi.
Catchphrases : (with a chuckle) "Indeed!"
Possessions  : Hunter's clothing, long bow, Manhound puppy - Bacchus.

Marco was a simple goat-herd as a boy, but a rogue Marsh Wolf attacked his
goats and Marco nearly lost his life defending them with only a small knife.
No doubt, Marco would have been killed had a Mulatore not been tracking the
beast for the past four days.  The hunter let fly his arrow just as the wolf
leapt for the boy.  Shaking with fear, Marco collapsed under the dead weight
that fell on top of him.  The Mulatore praised his bravery and the deed won
Marco some fame in his village.  Marco began to idolise his rescuer - it was
Mulatores do this and Mulatores do that, and eventually his father arranged
for a hunting trip with one of them in the hope that the reality of a
Mulatore's life might take the wind out of his sails.

It didn't and years later Marco joined them.  He had perfected his wil-
derness survival skills; he had always been an expert with the sling and
could now handle a bow.  He knew the ways of many animals and could immitate
the call of the Marsh Wolf.  He was full of tall stories about how he had
tracked this beast or that beast to its lair, and he even claimed to have
seen a Slagworm crawl out of the marsh in the moonlight.  No one was
surprised when he went to Miragliano and took fee from the city-officials.

Marco prospered and grew in stature amongst the Mulatores.  To start
with, he kept to the moorlands of his birth but, eventually, he accepted the
higher fee and entered the Marshes as well.  There he became known to the
Maldisi and is one of the few outsiders to have undergone the painful
Ceremony of the Madonna.  They also taught him to use their long marsh-bows
and to recognise their marsh-signs.  Marco has taken to the long-bow in a
big way and is set to become one of the City-States best archers.  Marco, of
all the Mulatores, knows best the reasons behind the Maldisi's recent
attacks on caravans and it is because of this that he has been chosen to
petition the Duce himself to force the merchants to pay more for the marsh-
paper.

Marco received the request from the Maldisi leader while he was at home
in his village.  He had been there for some weeks, recovering from an arrow
wound that had threatened to go bad.  While he was home, one of the other
villagers brought in a Manhound puppy that had been found on the moors.
Occasionally the Feranti Kennels, take weak or sick puppies out to the wilds
and abandon them.  Some of them, though, are left out because they aren't
"pedigree material" - in the case of a Tilean Manhound this means a non-
grey.

Marco made an offer for the dog - he wasn't sure why he did that, but he
did it - and Marco gave the beast a name; Bacchus.  The puppy has grown a
fair bit in the 3 weeks since then and Marco is very fond of the dog.

Marco is now in Miragliano with Bacchus by his side (it cost him a full
Doblone to be allowed to bring the dog inside the city) and he is looking
for a way to contact the Duce.

Age : 25.

* Immitate Animal Calls - Marco is able to immitate a wide number of
animals found in the marsh.  From the buzzing/clicking of the Cabuti-fly to
the terrifying howl of the Marsh Wolf, Marco can do them all.

Plotlines:

The main plotline for Marco is his mission to see the Duce - he cannot
do this openly as there are many members of the Grassi who would violently
oppose him in this.  They would see the petition as thinly disguised black-
mail, and they have so many grievances against the Maldisi anyway that the
only thing they want is for the Duce to outlaw the Maldisi and send an army
against them.

If Marco succeeds in meeting the Duce amicably - the Duce will listen to
the Maldisi grievance and promise to pass a law that ALL Miragliano written
state business has to be upon Marsh-Paper: the entire Maldisi output will
be bought at the current rate (which is way below what it used to be) from
now on.  In return for this the Maldisi will immediately stop attacking
traffic on the roads and work with the Mulatores in keeping the marshes free
of other bandits and monsters.  The Duce will add that if the Maldisi fail
to accept these terms he will raise an army and eradicate every last one of
them.  Any PC-party that helps Marco achieve this aim should recieve a
suitable EP award.

The wound that forced Marco to return home for a while was from an
arrow.  About a month ago Marco was homing in on a nest of <SWAMP-VERMIN?>
when he unexpectedly came upon some men disposing of a body in the marshes.
Some sixth sense warned them and they looked round almost as soon as Marco
appeared.  There were three of them, but only one was of note.  He dropped
his end of the body and unslung his bow in one movement.  The arrow knocked
and he let it fly.  It struk Marco in the left side and he staggered back
into the marsh-reeds.  Though it pained him, Marco moved quickly away but
there were no sounds of pursuit and he lived.

The unknown archer in the marshes was Angelo Torrelini a member of the
Cacciabores della' Ombra.  The two could cross paths in Miragliano and Marco
has that Tilean sense of honour that demands revenge.

As it stands, Marco would get minced if he went up against Angelo in a
straight fight - and Angelo is not a man to offer quarter.  Any PC who
attempts to disuade Marco from challenging Angelo to a duel should get 5EPs
but when Marco goes ahead then the PC who first offers to act as his second
should get a bonus 5EPs and if the party stops Angelo from killing Marco
(they'd better!) then 20EPs all round.  Angelo and his second (plus a few
hidden crossbowmen if the party turns out in force) will allow Marco to be
rescued - amid a volley of insults for stopping the duel from reaching its
proper conclusion (Marco will be upset about this later - he had been beaten
and was prepared to die but he will snap out of it in a day or two.  But
if the party launches an all out assault with the obvious intent to kill
Angelo rather than to rescue Marco, then you should launch a vicious
counter-attack - don't allow Angelo to be killed off this easily!

The House of Feranti will not be pleased to learn that an "un-pedigreed
brown" is out walking around and might well "question" Marco as to where he
got Bacchus or even try to kill the beast.

Bacchus is two months old now and is still very much the puppy.  Far too

is a Manhound's finest quality.  Apart from his coat - a smooth brown
instead of the silver-grey - he is a perfect specimen.

PADOTTE FERANTI			Merchant, ex-Student

Appearance   : Short.  Narrow blue eyes.  Dark brown hair.
Personality  : Controlled.  Always looking for alterior motives in others.
Insanity     : Blinded by revenge.
Motivations  : Find who killed his father, find out why, then kill them.
Catchphrases : "In your opinion.",
               "This, I don't need."
Possessions  : Expensive but plain clothes.

Dom Feranti owns the Feranti Kennels outside Miragliano and several Insulae
within the city.  He is a young man having only recently been taken under
his father's wing and groomed to take over the family business.  Unfortun-
ately his father was killed a few days ago.  Padotte studied Commerce and
Politics at the University of Miragliano but it was always intended that he
should take over the running of the family business at some point - although
under happier circumstances.  As a student he failed to shine, finding it
far more enlightening to drink away his study time, and he could often be
found at the "Alla Rosa Insanguinata" ("The Bloody Rose", it is).

He was shaken by the sudden death of his father who was somewhat clinically
assassinated - Pater Feranti was found sitting in his favourite chair in
the family library, his neatly severed head was not.  Obvious signs of entry
were found and no supernatural agency was suspected, yet despite this, the
ritualised forms of assassination were not obeyed and no formal message of
regret was received.

  |respects.  His mother was weeping loudly behind him.  His sisters    |
  |were at her side but their tears, like his own, would come only      |
  |during the ceremony.  A second cleric touched his shoulder, it was   |
  |almost time.  One last time, he glanced over at the wreaths - what he|
  |searched for was not there.  With a deep breath he turned and moved  |
  |to the door, pausing only to squeeze Eleanor's shoulder as he passed.|
  |At the door, Pieter, the loyal family retainer, stood respectfully,  |
  |his head bowed as Dom Feranti approached.  The group of men beside   |
  |him - one an elf, he noticed - did not show such respect.  Their eyes|
  |were curious, intruding upon his grief.  He pulled out a pouch of    |
  |gold from within his robes, weighing it in his hands.  How their eyes|
  |followed it!  Such vermin - that they should have need of these      |
  |freebooters!  He held out the purse for the Elf to take.  Their eyes |
  |locked and suddenly he realised that this one didn't care about the  |
  |gold.  Elves!  Who could understand them?                            |
  |                                                                     |
  |"You have explained things, Pieter?"                                 |
  |                                                                     |
  |"They have agreed to our terms.", the small Pieter still could       |
  |not raise his head to acknowledge the new Dom - Julio Feranti's death|
  |had hit everyone hard.                                               |
  |                                                                     |
  |Padotte released his hold on the purse and the Elf passed it to      |
  |the one on his right - a bearded man with the look of The Empire     |
  |about him.  "Who did this is not as important as the one who ordered |
  |it done.  Remember that."  He motioned that they should leave but it |
  |took all his strength not to strike out at the Elf.  Surely that     |
  |could not have been a smile?                                         |
  |                                                                     |
  |The new Dom Feranti turned and went back inside the chapel.          |

16.1    Maps
------------

16.1.1  Map 01 - Miragliano's basement islands (Filename : mislands.gif)
------

It shows the islands Miragliano was/is build upon.
It doesn't show the city Miragliano itself !!!!
So don't be confused about that...

It comes zipped in GIF format.

Attention : I added an arrow to the north and a measure.

16.1.2  Map 02 - Map of the plague camp (Filename : plagcamp.gif)
------

It shows the plague camp and its garrison outside Miragliano, to which
all those pitiful come, who show signs of a plague or disease.

It comes zipped in GIF format.

Some explanations :

The smaller of both forts is the garrison, the larger one is the plague
camp.  What looks like dirt should represent the trails of coaches and
persons in the marsh ground.  The small circles inside the camp represent
tents in which the camp inhabitants mostly live.

16.1.3  Map 03 - Miragliano's islands & bridges (Filename : misland2.gif)
------

It shows Miragliano's islands and the bridges between them. Also
it shows the palace district, where the Duce lives.
At this stage, it doesn't show the area where bridges and platforms are
built into the water (no islands) and where the poorest of the poor live.
