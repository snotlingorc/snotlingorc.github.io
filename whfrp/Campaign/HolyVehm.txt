Subject: WFRP & Secret Societies (long)

Hi all,

One of the mailing lists I receive is the Chaosium Digest, a semi-regular
source of information and discussion regarding that company's games.  In the
latest issue was an interesting article about a medieval German secret
society and its use in the Nephilim game.  The article includes a reference
to a book that details 39 secret societies. (One wonders just how secret they
really were, though......:) )  Anyway, here's the portion of the article most
relevant to WFRP players.  I've placed a hold on the book here at the UCLA
library, and I'll give a review after I have a  look at it.

Subject: Secret Societies: The Holy Vehm

Recently, I had the good fortune to discover, in the library of a
friend's father, "Famous Secret Societies" by John Heron Lepper,
author of "Problems of the Fama" and "The Testaments of Master
Francois Villon" amongst others.  The book was published by Sampson
Low, Marston & Co.  Ltd.  of London and regrettably gives no clue as to
when it was published although it appears that it may have been
sometime in the fifties.

The book devotes 339 pages to the coverage of 39 "Famous Secret
Societies", several of which are detailed briefly in the Nephilim
gamebook.

As time allows, I shall present summary details and assertions about
these and others of the societies covered in this fascinating source.
GMs may choose to use, adapt or reject these ideas in their own
Nephilim campaigns.

I would add that it is quite conceivable that the planned Secret
Societies sourcebook for Nephilim may well clash with my own findings
on several issues.  That's life, but at least GMs will have the luxury
of choice.  Either that, or some of this may find its way into that
supplement.

My own observations are [bracketed].

I start with one of my favourites, the Holy Vehm:

THE VEHMGERICHT

History

In the middle of the thirteenth century, the Emperor lacked the
ability to effectively control Westphalia.  The area was at the mercy
of robber barons, thieves and bandits.  The Vehmgericht was the name
given to the organisation that came into being amongst the harried
masses in order to protect themselves against the lawless.  Some of
its supporters claim that the organisation was originally founded by
Charlemagne in the eight century.  [Perhaps the tribunals were a
reincarnation of a more ancient body and named after such]

Name

Fehm or Vehm probably derives from Fama as the law founded on common
fame.  However, Fehm also meant something set apart [Ideal link to the
Nephilim: The Court of the Outsiders?].  The first written account of
the Vehm is in a Latin document from 1251 which, in dealing with the
town of Brilon mentions the 'secret court vulgarly called Vehm or
Freiding.'

Organisation

Tribunals were normally held in the morning in the open at well known
locations [hence cross-roads].  In Nordkirchen, they were held in the
churchyard, whilst in Dortmund, they took place in the Marktplatz.

The courts had many names: Fehmding, Assembly of the Vehm; Freistuhl,
Free Chair; Heimliches Gericht, Secret Court; Heimliches Acht, Secret
Tribunal; Heimliches Beschlossenes Acht, Secret Closed Court and
Verbotene Acht, Forbidden Tribunal.

All free men might serve in the court and took an oath upon joining.
These adherents, known as Die Wissenden, or Knowing, Ones were said to
have numbered at least 100,000 and were organised into several ranks.
At the bottom of the heap were the Frohnboten, the officers of the
tribunal.  Above the were placed the deputy judges, or Freischoeffen.
These two groups were said to act as jurors, constables, inquisitors,
detectives and executioners.  The top men were the judges, Die
Stuhlherren, of whom there were very few.

The oath taken by Die Wissenden has been translated as follows:

       "I swear by my sacred honour that I will hold and conceal the 
		secrets of the Holy Vehm,
	From sun and from moon, 
	From man and from woman,
	From wife and from child,
	From village and from field,
	From grass and from beast,
	From great and from small,
	Except from the man
	Who the Holy Vehm serve can,
	And that I'll leave nothing undone
	For love of for fear,
	For garment or gift,
	For silver or gold,
	Nor for any wife's scold."
		
The Vehmgericht purportedly had its own secret written code, the
preserved writings of which often refer to the initials SSSGG.  The
initials are thought to refer to Stock, Stein, Strick, Gras, Grein
(Stick, Stone, Halter, Grass, Quarrel) [The tools of the HV?].  A
secret means of recognition was that, when sitting at a meal table,
members of the HV would turn their knives through 180 degrees so that
the point was directed towards themselves.

Some tribunals were open to the public, those at Nordkirchen and
Dortmund presumably being obvious examples and such were know as
Offenbare Dinge.  Heimliches Acht, however, were for Die Wissenden
only and intruders, if caught, were hanged on the spot.  Hanging, in
fact, was the only sentence that the Vehmgericht passed, this being
from the nearest tree.  [This explains the rulebook stating that
killings took place at cross-roads and the bodies hung from a tree].

Probably the powers and focus of the Vehmgericht changed and shifted
over many years and there is no clear idea as to quite what crimes
they sought to punish, although the fact that they only administered
hangings gives us some clue as to the severity of the crimes they
sought the perpetrators of.  It has variously been claimed that they
sought out those who had broken one of the biblical Ten Commandments
and that children, women, Jews, heathens and the higher nobility were
exempted.  There is no definitive answer [interpretation of the Vehmic
law is at the discretion of the Stuhlherr?].

Procedure

A Freischoeffe would make an accusation in one of the courts and a
summons would be issued.  Three such summonses would be issued, each
45 days apart, giving the accused ample opportunity to make a defence.
If the accused was not one of Die Wissenden then they would be
summoned to appear before an Offenbare Dinge, otherwise it would be a
secret court.  Quite simply, an oath breaker was by definition a
traitor and evidence of such could only rightly be present before
those who were also initiates.  If the accuser could present seven
witnesses to swear to his own good reputation and the accused did not
appear before the court then he would be condemned in absentia.  The
upshot of this is that the accused became an outlaw and any three
supporters of the Vehm were within their rights to hang him.  The
accusing Freischoeffe was given a sealed document that they could show
when claiming assistance from other members of the Vehmgericht.
Anyone who aided or abetted the condemned in evading the Vehm was
liable to an instant hanging.

Should the accused decide to answer a summons, they were to produce
thirty witnesses to attest to their good character whilst the accuser
had the right to do likewise.  Each was able to have his lawyer
represent him.  If convicted, the condemned had the right of appeal
from a Heimliches Acht held in Dortmund.

During a trial, a sword and a halter lay on a table in front of the
judge symbolising the judge's powers of administering justice and the
penalty entailed by transgression.  When a convicted man had been
hung, a knife was stuck into the tree from which he hung to
demonstrate by whose authority he had been convicted [Hence the
cruciform dagger].
	
Points of interest

In 1371, Emperor Karl IV recognised the legitimacy of the Vehm in
Westphalia and the punishment of evil persons was handed over to them.

In 1470, three Stuhlherren summoned the Emperor Frederick III and his
Chancellor.  Funnily enough they didn't show.

The last free court in Munster was abolished in 1811 by order of the
French invaders [we can assume for game purposes that the organisation
went underground at this time].
