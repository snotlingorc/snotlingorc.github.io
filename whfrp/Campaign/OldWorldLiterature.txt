Literature in The Old World
By Michael Andersen

As a game master you may well find yourself in a situation where the players want to examine some library of no importance. Rather than tell them this, you can use some of the following books. Some of the information will reefer to a "Personal timeline". This is a piece of paper you can make for characters with history skill, which contains information, in the form of a timeline, showing what a character knows. Just skip this rule if you don't like it, and instead tell the player what happened on a specific  year, when they read some of the books. The first information in the following list of books is to be read like this: Name of book, Author, Availability, year, price, and language/ languages. Shortcuts are C-Common, U-Uncommon, R-Rare, V-Very rare, E-Extremely rare (only 1-4 versions of the book).
Unless otherwise stated, the player must pay 100 EP, and make an INT test, in order to teach skills from books.
In these rules the theology skill has been divided into several skills, like the specialist weapon, Secret language, and so on. This means that normal theology skill only covers the religion from the players homeland (eg. Old world religion). The proscribed cults have been further divided into the specific gods. So theology - Tzeentch skill grants the player knowledge of the Tzeencth  religion and understanding of the different Tzeentch cults, who also have different aims and translations of the Tzeentch religion. Alternatively you can have the EP cost lower, but even 100 EP will do just fine.You can also judge that the specialist Theology tests, gives a +20 bonus, instead of Theologys +10.
'Normal' under a books language description simply means the normally spoken language of the Author (eg. Empire=Reikspiel, Brettonia=Bretton)
The table below are meant to be used with penalties and bonuses. Forexample a merchants townhouse library may receive a -15 modifier while a huge verena temple might receive a +10 modifier.
Use the name table in the character pack rule additions for quick names of the books author (unless one is mentioned), and also the place of origin table when you have to randomly determine a country or city.
In White Dwarf issue 108 - The WFRP adventure Terror in the darkness, the author Carl Sargent made use of a bestiary title with a Latin name. In my personal opinion this gives an ancient atmosphere to the book. I know there is no parallel to Latin in The Warhammer world, but in my campaign i have introduced a Latin Arcane language from the old Remas empire (Caput Mundi : The capital of the world - Old Latin pronouncing for Rome). This language is most often used within the religious cults followed in the old Remean empire (ex. The Solkan cult), and some old literature is also written in this language. Clerics of cult which emanates from the southern lands (like Tilea, Remean Empire etc.) must learn the Arcane Latin language on their first level. 
Below are some guidelines, or rather words, for generating Latin names. Don't worry about grammatical correctness, if one of your players complaint about it - Smack him in the head, kill his character or just ignore him!!!!!

D100	Type of book:				
?-27 Novels and fiction
        1-48 -Love stories, Various, C, ?, 2-10 gc, Normal
                Trivial love stories. Descriptions: Man meets girl, can't
                get eachother because of a complication, usually a tragic
                ending. Alternatively a character reading one of these books,
                should make a T test midway in the book to stay awake.
        49  - Journey to Morrslieb, Julius Werner, R,  2403, 25 gc,  classical
                A very confusing book about an expedition to Morrslieb in a
                flying ship. The reader gains 1D3-1 insanity points.
        50-96 -Realistic stories (find an appropriate name), - , C-R, - ,
                5-20 gc,  usually Normal
                These books contains fictional stories, but an INT should
                be secretly rolled (History +10). Failure indicates that
                the reader believe that the contents of the book is true
                (a historical book). Add something false to the players
                personal timeline. Ex. "2311 - Dieter the beggar was
                crowned as Emperor".
        97-98 -Dark Dreams and Forbidden Pastimes, Mordecai Thandos, U,
                2342, 30-50 gc, Reikspiel
                (From Deathrock)
                Although somewhat peverse, the book has nothing to do with
                anything evil or chaotic. Mainly a volume of erotic verse
                concerning some historical figures.
        99-00 -Arabian nights
                A collection of histories from Araby. Some bears elements
                of erotic writting. The book is renowned for the history of
                Al-nadim and the Djini in the bottle, Ali-Kebab and the
                40th Bandits, and others. Basically the same as the Arabian
                nights in our world, just change the names.
                The reader will get a slight insight in the culture of
                Araby, and also learn about the exsistence and nature of
                Djinns and Efreets.

                (medival Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde)
                This book is a play by the famous playwright Detlef Sierck.
                Originally by the Kislevite dramatist V.I. Tiodrov, but now
                adapted by Detlef. The story takes action in Kislev and is
                about a young cleric of Shallya named Dr.Zhiekill who
                experiments with a potion that turns him into the evil
                Mr.Chaida.
        -The treachery of Oswald, Detlef Sierck, U, 2503 , 50 gc, Reikspiel
                (As proscribed in the Warhammer fiction book "Drachenfels"),
                The real story about  Detlef's attempt to stage Oswald von
                Konigswald's adventure, about how he killed Constant
                Drachenfels, in Castle Drachenfels itself. After a serie of
                intriques, Drachenfels emerges during the play and tries to
                kill the Emperor and everyone else. Oswald himself hasn't
                killed Drachenfels but instead made a pact to save his life.
                Instead it is Detlef who kills Drachenfels in the holy name
                of Sigmar (the Ulric cult has allready tried to ban the play,
                but haven't succeded).
        -Drachenfels, Detlef Sierck, R, 2502, 100-200 gc, Reikspiel,

                original play script by Detlef Sierck, about Oswald Von
                Konigswald, Genevieve, Anton Veidt, Erzbeth, And Rudi's
                adventure in Castle Drachenfels. This play was made under
                the instructions of Oswald von Konigswald who freed Deltef
                Sierck from the Mundsen keep in order to make this play.
                It is known today that the play itself doesn't describe the
                situation as it actually was, since the traitor Oswald and
                Drachenfels was the only one to know it by that time.
        -The world of theater.
                A kind of dictionary of fameous playwrights.
                Here is the Malvoisin part (from the novel Genevieve Undead):
                Malvoisin Bruno (2440 - ?)
                The author of the banned play "Seduced by Slaaneshi",
                followed by more perverse and sick plays which was never
                played on stage. After a anonymously play script, where the
                Emperor has intercourse with a She-Goat, was traced back to
                him, the watch showed up to arrest him but found him totally
                altered. It is said that he escaped him and was never seen
                again.

        2 -Written Note Book, -, -, -, ?, -
                A note book found in a library can either be blank, or it
                can contain some written notes. In this way you can
                introduce handouts with clues concerning your campaign.
                Typically the notebook will have been written by the owner
                of the library, containing notes from books and other
                research.
                Notebooks by other persons can also be found. They tend to
                have information on researches which has been of interest
                to the library's owner, and thus obtained by him.
        3 -Diary
                Like the written notebooks, a diary can also be used to
                introduce clues in a campaign, or just be a boring scholars
                day by day events.
                Diary's of famous persons are rare but not totally
                impossible to find. In a larger library you can allow a 10%
                chance that the diary are the memoirs of a historical person.
                Ex.: Heinrich Kemlers dark diary, Magnus the Pious warfare
                diary, etc.
        4 -Personal Sketchbook
                This book is a notebook containing drawings by some unknown
                person or perhaps the library's owner.
                The drawings can be some irrelevant drawings of nature areas,
                cities, or persons, or perhaps drawings to illustrate
                different subject in books studied by the drawings author.
        5 -Hollow book.
                This book has been hollowed to make it contain a hidden item.

        6 -False book.
                This book has a false cover. Roll a new book (ignoring this
                result and any other like this), this is the front cover.
                Roll another book, adding +10 to your roll - This is the

        -Cities of the Old World
                Books about cities in the Empire, can contain a lot of
                different informations. To randomly determine a specific
                city, you should roll on the appropriate "Place of Birth"
                table in the character pack rule addition.
                Informations about the cities will depend on how informative
                the book are (GM's choice). City informations of the
                Reikland cities can be found on page ?? or in DotR. Parravon
                area: page ??.  Middenland: CotWW/COC.

                By reading a book of a specific city, the character will be
                more likely to find his way in the city when he arrives as a
                newcomer, and will probably also have learned the right
                etiquette's, etc. All this depends, of course, on the
                reliability of the book. Remember also that the books
                informations may not be "up to date".
        -Land, continents and areas

        -Naggaroth, Banadl Anwesu, R, ?, 200 gc, Eltharin
                This book is represented in White Dwarf magazine #?? In the
                article Witchelves of Naggaroth.
        -Maps
                Maps can also typically be found in a library. These maps
                are usually detailed maps of specific areas. Two maps of the
                same areas can contain different information. For instance
                one of two maps of the Empire have, as an addition, marked
                spots of major Skaven lairs, while the other only have the
                human settlements. This can be a good situation for
                introducing various maps for you campaign. The maps might
                also be included in the books above.
56-66  Books of skill and trade, (pick a name or roll one at random ), C-U,
        ?, 30-120 gc, depends on contents but usually Normal
        These books contains information about a skill or trade. The
        appropriate skill can be learnt in the normal way by reading the
        book. The following skills can be learnt from a book

        1-3     Arcane Language. Books about Arcane languages, is both a
                dictionary of words and also contains various information
                about the language. Books about Arcane languages differs
                a lot from each other in quality. See RoSM for more details
                about Arcane languages.

                This book can teach the reader Backing skill, which is very
                similar Cook skill. The skill can't be used in the
                Wilderness, as an oven, flour, water, sugar, at least is
                required. But in a city, employment is fairly easy. As well
                as bread, the character is also able to make pastries. In
                game terms you should allow Halflings to have this skill
                already, in addition to their cook skill.

                will be able to lean Heal Wounds, Manufacture Drugs, Cure
                disease, and Prepare Poison. Apart from this the book

                reader will be able to cure by using the cure disease skill
                (except from special, almost, uncureable diseases), a chapter
                on human anatomi (a theoretic start on learning surgery).
                Here is an example of a variant from the above example:
                Speculum Amoris, Massimo (of Bologna)
                (Source: Il Nome Della Rose)
                Sort of medical book about the disease 'Love sickness'. The
                book contains various quotes from other writers and books,
                about the subject.
                Ex. quotes: Abu Bakr-Muhammed Ibn Zakariyya ar-Razi from
                Liber Continens: Love is paralleled  with Lycantropi, making
                the affected act like a wolf. His sight will faint, his body
                will shrink, and he will become very dry and thirsty. At
                last the affected person will roam the cemeteries like a
                Wolf.
        00   "Magic" book. This book is about magic tricks, not real magic,
                but about palming and other entertainer tricks. It is
                possible to learn Palm object skill, sometimes Hypnotise or
                Pick pocket, and various tricks which simulate Petty magic
                tricks (e.g. Pulling a rabbit out of a hat = Produce small
                creatures, except that preparations and Palm object are
                used). All these tricks also requires long practical
                training.

        *: A religeous book containing a random god or god group (e.g. The
        law siblings Solkan, Arianka, Alluminas).
        You should reefer to page 10 in Apocrypha Now, called Skills and
        Careers (Also found in The Restless Dead Campaign or White Dwarf

67-77 Folklore.
        Books about folklore will not necessarily be true, but may have
        something to do with real events. As GM you should feel free too
        improvise on stories from the timeline. This roll could also be a
        good way to introduce a local earth spirit, or maybe a specific
        daemon.
        If you want too, you can reefer to the Historical section, and add
        elements of folklore to the result.
        1-50 Religion
                These books contains informations about religion. Either a
                specific cult or the gods in a specific area. When you roll
                a specific area below you should add a 10% chance that the
                book is non-devoted and instead contains informations about
                the different religions in that area - normally without the
                secret or outlawed religious cults. When rolling a single
                good, there will be 50% chance that the book is written by
                an author which is devoted to the religion (01-25 means
                that it will be a copy of the main religious book of that
                religion - Bible) - This will affect the description of the
                cult which will be very optimistic.

                Ex. Article: The hammer of the stars:
                "Do you know 'Honorius'? The 'Riddle Song of the Seals'?
                In most cities they have verses which are not sung elsewhere.
                We would love to hear yours."
                The Commentary: "Scholars call the riddle song a parable of
                the soul's path to perfection. But the old view has not been
                refuted, namely that the seal were real sacred objects of
                great mage-ic power, not symbols, and the riddles refer to
                their location."
                "Some say the whole riddle song has a greater secret woven
                into it - the way to an even older and more sacred item: The
                Hammer of the Stars. Its use cannot be attained without the
                mastery of the Seven Seals. It is protected by the mesmeric
                influence of the song: one cannot hear ir and remember it

                The print says "In memory of the great Marvin, by his son".
                The book describes the life long adventure of Marvin
                Brutalticos' search of his father. It also describes how he
                slew Praznagar, demon prince of the horned rat, while the
                cowardly sorcerer Bernard Philip de Garson lay wounded and
                unconscious. Later this poor wreck of a wizard consumed
                warpstone, by accident, and mutated into a very amusing form.
                Later again, this poor wizard got his stilk eyeballs crushed
                and was forced to swallow the throuses of a troll, and got an
                ugly disease.

               -Hagmar Wyrmslayer. A lengendary hero who appears in the
                folklores of Norsca and the Wasteland. He slew a dragon that
                was laying waste to the Forest of Shadows/Southern Coast of
                Norsca. Hagmar, son of a blacksmith, volunteered to go and
                slay the beast. He filled a gutted carcass of a deer with
                stones and set it to roast. The dragon swallowed the carcass
                and the stones shattered inside the furnace-hot belly of the
                dragon, killing it instantly. Hagmar looted the dragon's
                cave and became rich. He forged several items of note, see
                The Dagger of Hagmar, The Chainmail of Hagmar, the Talisman
                of Hagmar, and The Buckle of Hagmar.

85-90  Bestiaries, - , U-E, - , 30-100 gc, Usually Classical 
        Bestiaries contains information of a variety of creatures. You can
        determine the number of creatures by rolling a D10+4. Some bestiaries
        might have more at your discretion. Remember that the creatures don't
        have to be true creatures since many of these books have information
        about imagined creatures, probably just to attract the readers. You
        can use the information in the WFRP bestiary. Following creatures
        contains more information: Dragon ogres (ROC-LD 154, see hand out
        section), Minotaurs (ROC-LD 146), Beastmen (ROC LD 128). For other
        creatures, you can roll up a chaos spawn, and make it a hybrid
        between two creatures.
        GM's with copies of Warhammer 40K could also use creatures from other
        planes and worlds (one of these creatures could have entered the
        warhammer world via a chaos vortex and been encountered by the
        author), using the WFB to WFRP rules in the bestiary in the WFRP rule
        book.
        Names of Bestiaries could essentially be something like Liber
        Monstrorum de Diversis generibus (Latin:Book about different kinds
        of monsters), or Bestiis, or De Bestiis (Latin: About animals,
        basically the same meaning as bestiary) - type
        ex.:De Beastiis Chaotis for a bestiary containing creatures of Chaos.
91-93 A race and its culture
       -Skaven Society, Bargriam master of La Maisontaal, R, 100 gc,
        Classical, 2491
        This book describes the society of the Skavens. Although the player
        may actually already know it, his character should obtain knowledge
        of the different Skaven clans, and the council of the thirteen. The
        clans described in this book is Clan Scruten, Moulder, Skryre,
        Pestilens, And Eshin and also how they are positioned in the society.
        The player can recognize a Skavens clan on a successfully Int check,
        if it is a clan from the ones mentioned above. For more information
        of the Skavens, you should reefer to the book of the rat in the
        warhammer archives (I havent read it yet, but it looks promising).
        Also you can let the player read the section about Skavens in the
        WFRP bestiary.
        The following can be added to a players personal Timeline:
        IC 2491 Bagrian Master of La Maisontaal, infiltrates Skavenblight
        and discovers the Black Arc. You can also add various skaven events
        from the timeline (ex. 2387).
       - Ogrish Standards of Etiquette, Translated by professor Werner
        Bermann university of Nuln, S 100 gc, Reikspiel, 2476
        This book describes the Ogres and how to deal with them without being
        eaten. First part of chapter one is represented in the Doomstone
        adventure Blood in Darkness, or Hogshead's Fire and blood.
        Other informations can be found in the WFRP beastiary - such as
        phrases, physique, and so on.
94-96 Philosophy (non Theological)
      - The spherical earth, Von Haldstadt, R, 2475,150 GC, Reikspiel
        This book described the theory that the earth is round, a theory
        believed and spoken off by a small number of people in The Old World.
        The book mocks other writters description of the end of the world,
        and claims that the earth has no end, as its spherical.
        players with different opinions will have an opportunity to roleplay
        some amusing discussions.
      - The non-existent Gods (Front cover reads: Your Gods have perished!),
        Anonymous, R, 2432, 50 GC, Reikspiel
        This book is about the theory of atheist's and try to convince the
        reader that the Gods doesn't exist with different examples and
        explanations. The author declares himself a follower of the Chaos
        God Necoho, not because he believes he exist but because of the
        ideas the name symbolizes.
        It will be hard for a player whether to denounce the book Chaotic or
        not. Most of the Old Worlds religious cults (Especially Ulric,
        Sigmar, and the more uncommon Law cults) have banned the book as
        being blasphemous and many copies have been burnt (including the
        Print house in Carroburg), while others is preserved and kept away
        from the public in the larger Verena temples.
      - Alternative Dimensions, Leonardo of Remas, R, 2378, 250 GC, Arcane -
        Latin
        This book describes the theory of planar dimensions, and warpspace.
        A description of the Old Slann and their ability to travel through
        dimensions is contained within the unsorted pages, but it is more
        theory than actual facts.
      - The philosophy of Morlum Necksnapper, Morglum necksnapper, E, ?, ?,
        Orrakh
        This book contains different writtings by the marauding Orc Morglum
        Necksnapper, who was believed - by his fellow orcs, to be a great
        thinker, but most important of all - could belt other orcs who
        opposed him into a pulp. Three of his philosophies are represented
        in the handout section.
97-98  Foreseens/Prophesies
       -Lieber Malific, Marius Hollseher, R, 2325, 250 GC, Reikspiel
        The books main parts can easily be read by a player, by showing him
        specific pages of the Realms of chaos books (represented in the
        handout section without illustrations). The part "The book of chaos
        foreseen" can be found in ROC-SD page 12, 38, and 68. The part "The
        book of hated Khorne" can be found in ROC-SD page 110, and 210.
        The part "The book of contemptible Slaanesh", can be found in ROC-SD
        page 106. Handouts have been provided in appendix A. An INT test is
        made for each of the last two parts. Failure means a gain of 1D3
        insanity points, and success means that for the price of 100 EP,
        a special Khorne, or Slaanesh theology skill can be gained.

        01-08  Grimoire
                Grimoires will typically contain only one type of magic
                (eg. Necromantism or Elementalism). Determine the type on
                this table.:

                If you play with the color colleges, you might want to use
                the following table, when rolling a petty or battle result:

        15-16 Books on spellcasting
                Books about spell casting are rare indeed, since magic is
                usually learned by a tutor, but they do exist. When found
                they will typically be combined with a minor grimoire (The
                grimoire will always be in Arcane language due to the spell
                pronouncing).

                These books concerns the studying of magical Undead creatures.
                Some can be like a bestiary, while others can be stories
                about Undead creatures. The view points can be neutral -
                boring dry facts!, or bear the stamp of religious viewpoints
                - being more like a warning or apocalyptic prophecies. It
                can of course also be an evil viewpoint, written by a
                Necromancer, telling more about how to use Undeads than warn
                against them. Depending on the contents, the reader will be
                able to acquire Identify Undead/Necromantic Lore skill from
                this book.

        28-36 Pox Vobiscum, no author, E, 2340, N/A, Reikspiel
                Claiming to have been written by a high priest of Nurgle,
                this is a declaration of a thousand year campaign to
                overwhelm the world, and destroy it in an orgy of disease and
                corruption. This may infact have been written by a
                witch-hunter for propaganda purpose. Reading this book gives
                the reader 1D3 insanity points. The book is highly
                illegal, and the owner risk finding himself at the wrong end
                of a rope. Nurgle followers would rather kill and steal the
                book, than pay for it.
        37-42 A lifetimes research on warpstone, Sufdilp Gyhr, E, 2449, 500
                gc, Classical
                This book is written on a pretty high level, making it
                completely impossible to understand without good knowledge
                on the subject (unlikely). If someone try a experiment from
                the book, it will end in a horrible disaster. If someone
                however is able to understand the book, there is nearly no
                restriction to what he can learn about the use of warpstone.
                The book is highly illegal, and death is the penalty of
                possessing it. A wizard  who has interest in the study of
                forbidden knowledge, will be willing to pay 500 gc for it,
                but will start at a far lower price. "Well I don't know.
                Its pretty ragged isn't it. I'll give you 25 crowns for it,
                probably the best offer you can get.". You can also show the
                player "Skaven armies" page 10+11.
        43-58 Demonic names and correspondences, Treaster, E,  ?, 500 gc,
                arcane language - Magick + demonic
                The book claims to reveal the true names of a number of
                lesser and mid-range daemons, as well as the use names of
                many others, including a few of the greater variety. It also
                contains a number of disguised mistakes, designed to trip up
                anyone not conversant with the theory, and able to spot the
                errors (apprentices for instance). The book is highly illegal
                and the owner can expect nothing less than hanging or burning
                by the authorities. A person with interest in demonology will
                start with a price of 50 gc (like the book a lifetime
                research on warpstone). If you wish, you can show the reader
                ROC-SD 41(right side), and ROC-SD 53. For sample daemon names,

                Supposely dictated from beyond the grave by a sorceress to
                her aprentice. This book deals with  the survival of the
                spirit and the realms it may encounter. The reader gains 1D3
                insanity points. The owner can get into serious trouble with
                religious cults.
        65-66 The Book of Transmutation, Anonymous, E, 200 gc, Classical, ?
                This book comprises of prophesies about the coming of
                Tzeentch. The reader can get an insight into the Theology
                and philosophy of Tzeentch.
        67-68 Daemon books
                Daemon books are books with a life of their own. A evil or
                chaotic Daemon has been bound into a book bound in human
                skin - and typically, also with pages of human skin, and
                inscribed with unholy symbols in Human blood, to fulfill
                some unknown task. These books have a life of their own, and
                a person does not choose to own the book, but the book
                Chooses its owner
                The Daemons can add passages in the book to influence the
                reader, and can also remove them again. It is also able to
                move (crawl) and does so at M 1/2 (halve the travel time for
                M 1), but only does so when no one can see it, since it
                prefers discretion and secrecy about its identity and
                presence.
                If it is necessary the Daemon can try to control the owner
                who will have to make a successful WP test in order to keep
                control of himself. The Daemon may not try to control again
                after 24 hours.
                The person who owns, or who is owned by, the book will become
                addicted to the book like a drug (see CotWW), and upon long
                isolation from the book (typically when it has found a new
                and better owner) he is, usually, driven crazy.
                Players with this book in their possession, are in for a
                nasty surprise and a lot of insanity points.
                Normal Daemon warding rules apply, but the book never tests
                for instability unless the Daemon has been freed.
                There are always a secret way to unbound the Daemon (some
                obscure ritual or merely a word) which the Daemon isn't aware
                of himself.
                Ex.: The book of Ashur (10% chance of this one), Unknown -
                Dark elf origin, E(1), Priceless, Various - mostly Dark
                tongue(but the Daemon chooses), ?
                This ancient, and very huge, book has been told to hold all
                spells in the world. Though lost and stolen many times, it
                has always found its way back into the hands of those who
                can be corrupted by the knowledge it contains.
                This book has a life of its own. Long time before the humans
                began to write books themselves, a mighty Daemon of
                Tzeencthian origin was bound into the book - its true name
                now long forgotten. The Daemon can teach the slave of the
                book spells, by adding passages in the book, referring to
                the spell the readers wants to learn, or the spell the
                Daemon wants the reader to learn. There are a 60% chance
                (-10% per level) that the reader will find the spell his
                looking for (at GM's discretion it will turn out to be another
                one when first used. Even magicks of another class can be
                learned in this way). Any spell learned from the book will
                always turn out to have devastating evil effect, and never
                benefit other than maybe the caster, and surely the Daemon.
                the reader will also gain D6 insanity points when learning a
                spell.
                The EP cost for learning spells is halved when learning a
                spell from this book.
                Each 24th hour, the bound Daemon may attempt to take control
                of the books slave (usually only when necessary). The owner
                must make a WP test in order to keep control of himself.
                There is a cumulative -5 modifier for each week the book has
                been in the characters possession.
                Each week there is a 30% chance that a Chaos attribute start
                developing, and additionally the subjects mind becomes more
                dark and sinister.
                All other rules for Daemon books apply (see above).

The Book of Chaos Foreseen

The Marcher Fortress
--------------------
There, the lands of Slaanesh stretched out below it, was a fortress of
whimsies and foibles. It was an unlovely thing, stained by war and victory.
Its towers, higher than any palace, wounded the sky. Its gateways were gaping
maws that could swallow and vomit forth whole armies. Its walls were darkened
stone, veined in unnatural colours and streaked with rotted lime and mortar.
Here, at the Marches of Slaanesh , was the fortress, a sign of sovereignty,
hated and condemmed by Khorne's bloody-handed whorshippers.

Before the Fortress gates stretched a forest of death. From the walls to the
near horizon was the dismal wrack of battle: corpses, the rusted swords and
armour of the fallen, the standards of Slaanesh and  Khorne, all abandoned
and forgotten long centuries ago.

The graves of the fallen had become a rich loam, sucked upon by the trees of
a dark forest. Pierced by tree roots, the dead had stirred once more, and
each branch bore a skull, mildewed and pregnant with loathing, a macabre and
cruel cargo. Only the ceaseless, horrendous laughter of the trapped shades
disturbed the field. Their fleshless jaws clattered in the still air; the
only reply the creaking of a windmill's sails and the grinding of its stones.

For in the shadow of the castle a windmill turned, its sails moving in the
still air, and their unclean breeze stirred the tattered flags of the death.
Within, the grindstones shuddered and groaned, while between, pinioned and
crushed, were the living corpses of the fallen, ground to make a rich mortar
of blood and bone, sinew and brains. Thus was the fortress maintained and
strengthened, its walls held aloft and marked by the power of mortality.
Thus was the field before it harvested.

And in the castle's mighty halls, its daemon overlords feasted and broke
bread, in conscious parody of mans small amentities. All this i saw in an
instant, and then my vision swept onwards....

The Inevitable City
-------------------
The City was built of dark madness, and it stretched across the land to fill
me with dread, for the path i trod would bring me to its portal. The City
stones had been quarried from the night and in all their details and
dressings they celebrated wickedness. No rain could wash the dust of evil
from that place and no wind could drive out its corrupt air.  Insanity had
served as architect, engineer and master to the City's masons, and had guided
all their levels and plumblines.

I turned my steps toward the far horizon, and still the City was before me.
Once more I turned, and again, and yet another turning. With each freshly
chosen course I drew nearer to the City gates, and its towers and walls
loomed higher. The fateful gateways was the end of every road, and despair
gnawed at my heart.

As I paused to seek a new escape, I saw that I was not alone on the
inevitable, hideous path. Between myself and the City stood a man, his head
bent and his eyes downcast, lost in some deep contemplation. As I watched,
he turned towards the City. His strides were firm, but he came no closer to
the gate, and I watched as he passed me by, and went further from the gates
until he vanished in the distant mists.

Thus was it possible to avoid the City and its brooding darkness, and I
resolved to march, against all reason, to the City. And when i did so, the
City grew no closer, but was soon lost to my sight...

The Drifting Castle
-------------------
The sky above grew darker than the blackest storm and a cold wind blew.
There was no rain but a shower of mortar dust, yellowed leaves and tatters
of flags.

No storm was in the sky, but a castle much as might be found in any mortal
land. Often had I imagined clouds to be trees and fish and mountains, and
now a foible of some nameless and uncaring power had given this fortress the
guise of a cloud. It was an island torn from the land, drifting as the mist
on a breeze, yet solid and firm. In all that I had seen, this was as strange
 as any of my visions.

The castle was as empty as any ruin. Like an animal stuffed and mounted under
glass, or a fish salted in a barrel, it had been preserved and pickled by the
whim of Chaos. Cast aside, and left to wander across the heavens, all was
still and desolate in that place. Its towers no longer knew the sounds of
men, it halls held no lofty nobles, its gates admitted no tenantry, no
sentinel stood guard, no porter waited by the gate. Even the carrion birds,
sole visitors to its sad portals, had enjoyed their fill of the dwellers'
hospitality.

The shadow of the castle fell across my eyes, and I could see no more.

The Book of Contemptible Slaanesh
---------------------------------
The Realm of Slaanesh was still and quiet, scented with sin and sweet
corruption. Its silence was not that of the grave, nor of ease at labours'
end, nor of peace after the storm. It was the malicious, plotting stillness
of evil waiting to be done: the silence before a moon or scream of pain and
pleasure. And in that awful quiet the small shrieks of slaanesh's daemons
were swallowed and muted. Their endless masque and antimasque of forbidden
pleasures and hideous pains were reduced to soft murmurs of decadence and
depravity.

As I passed over the Outer Realm of Slaanesh, my eyes were  numbed by its
pale  softness and my ears by its endless quiet. I began to belive that any
act could be contemplated if only it would provide variety and relief from
the silence. I was saved from further weakness by a vile noise, carried on
the perfumed and sickly breeze.

Torn from the rocks and stones, there was a buzzing like a hundred angry
swarm of bees. Before my eyes the land itself heaved  and pulsed, and spat
forth mewling, puking and misshapen creatures. Lumpen and hideous, the
monsters twisted and writhed in pleasure at their birthing, then turned upon
one another in search of further deprevaty. When one fell, exhausted from
its unlovely exertions, its fellows chortled and joked at its fate. The
corpse sank slowly into the earth of that foul vale, and a new beast was
given form from the clay.

As I witnessed the decadence of Slaanesh's land, I was seen by the creatures.
As those eyes beheld me, I turned and fled, the fiends of Slaanesh's Realm
at my heels

The Book of Hated Khorne 
------------------------
... I fell then, through charnel clouds and red mists that swirled about a
land of dark ruin and much despair. The cries of some enormous beasts, their
lowings of fear and desperation, reached my ears. And still i fell, driven
now by fertid winds, towards a walll or cliff of deepest red and blackened
iron. Its top was hidden in the clouds far above, its base was girt with
boulders and skulls, no larger in my sight than sand specks, that it piled
before its inexorable advance. The wall, for such it was, lay unbroken in
its awful perfection from horizon to horizon.

I grew afraid, for this was the Outer Realm of Khorne, the blood god, and
this wall his bastion, the fortress about the Inner Lands. It now seemed to
me that the stench of death broke my fall as I flew onwards, towards fresh
visions of this vast corner of Chaos.

And then ahead I saw a stair, surrounded by pinnacles and columns and
archers of blood and carven bone,circled by daemons bound within black iron,
brazen steps and shrieking mouths. All that could speak or gibber vomited
forth the praises of Khorne and shrieked out songs of Blood and Death. The
stair, its treads never built for mortal feet, climbed the dizzy heights,
pausing at times before profane runes and stained sacrifice stones. Within
the very fabric of the Daemon-thronged bastion were smaller landings, each
of which could have held a lofty and noble palace of our small world. The
stair twisted and rippled on itself, its daemons chuckling their insane
glee at its dreadful geometry. Still it climbed, ever upwards into the
clouds of gore that circled overhead

In all my vision, I saw not one living beast or man.

Through brazen gates and up endless steps I flew, my soul in dread as
daemons snapped about my heels. And before my eyes, as I rose from that
place, I beheld the fields and meadows of Khorne beyond the bastion, all
quiete soaked in red, stained with souls, and plante dwith endless lines of
corpses lashed to their stakes like a grotesquery of bean plants.

The declaration for Marienburgs independence
--------------------------------------------
Be it Known

* That in the matter of the succession to the Barony of Westerland, I,
  Emperor, Lord of Altdorf, Elector for the Grand Principality Of Reikland
  etc., etc., do decree as follows:
* Item - that following the heroic death of Graf Paulus van der maacht in
  the defence of The Empire, his line has become extinct
* Item -That while many claims have been pressed by the highest and most
  illustrious houses of The Empire, there is no clear heir to the said
  'Barony.
* Item - that, following  many centuries of war and the most recent struggle
  to save The Empire from the most deadly of foes, we cannot in all
  conscience ask any of our noble houses to shoulder this further burden of
  government in addition to the monumental tasks of healing ancient rifts
  and rebuilding The Empire's proper greatness.
* Therefore, it has  been decided, after careful consideration of all the
  issues appertaining to this matter, that the Barony of Westerland shall
  cease to be counted among the noble offices of The Empire.
* By this decree is created the Province of Westerland, which shall be
  governed by an appointed council drawn among the burghers of Marienburg.
  The said council shall retain all the duties and privileges previously
  invested in the Baron of Westerland, but may never seek or be granted
  the status of Imperial Elector and shall be chosen by appointment rather
  than blood succession.
* Made by me, this thirty-second day of Vorhexen, in the Year of Empire two
  thousand, three hundred and five.
