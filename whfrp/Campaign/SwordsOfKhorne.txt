Subject: [WFRP:1561] The Swords of Khorne

--
"The Swords of Khorne"

GM Notes:

"The Swords of Khorne" is the name of a large (16 members) chaos warband
that exists only to kill in the name of their bloody god.  It is led by
the manical fighter Bakal, and although a few members of the band may
be more powerful than him, none can match his fanatically fevor in combat.
The group of fiends stalk within the Empire, attacking with deadly
quickness.  Their targets include coaches, roadwardens, rural farms,
even small villages.  Very few indeed have survived a meeting with this
group...

They have no overall purpose except to slaughter; Bakal has a vague
notion of attacking a large city in a suicide run sometime in the
future, all for the glory of Khorne, but he has made no definite plans.
If this event were to happen, the band would disguise themselves as best
they could, sneak into the city, then kill.  Kill, kill, kill!  Men,
women, children, puppy dogs, rats, whatever.  If it is alive, Khorne
wants it dead.  And while they are most assuredly signing their own
death warrants, many a watchman (as well as innocent citizen) will die
by their blades before they fall.

Adventure Ideas:

Unless your group of pcs are tough (and I mean damn tough), the Swords of
Khorne should not be used as a standard encounter.  This group has managed
to take out small mercenary bands, units of knights, and the occasional
slayer; a party pcs would be chewed up and spit out by these guys.  They
should not be encountered unless the gm wants a bunch of dead pcs.

They are a great starting point for the creation of a few rumors, however.
The pcs may hear of a band of chaos stalking the land, murdering all they
find (perhaps a friend or family member of a pcs?).  Another good use
is to have a pc just starting out survive an attack on their town by
them (the pc hiding, of course); this will teach the character how brutal
chaos can be.  Perhaps the best use for them is to let the group of
stalwart adventurers know that discretion IS sometimes the better part
of valor if they normally have a tendency to let the sword solve all their
problems ("Those who live by the sword...").

An adventure could be designed around what happens after the Swords of Khorne
attack a small village, with the pcs hired/help rebuild the shattered remnants
of the mutilated town.  It would show another facet of evil that spawns from
chaos; one that is more often than not the most terrible...
