>From "In the Eyes of the Dragon" by Steven King: Dragon sand.

A VERY nasty poison with a slightly spicy taste. Causes the victems body 
temperature to slowly rise over a period of Toughness days. Toward the 
end causing them to start fires if they are not dowsed with water 
regularly. They die in agony with a jet green flame coming out of their 
mouth. Fatal doses are VERY small. Less than fatal doses will merely 
cause extreme fever(-20 to all precential traits -2 to other traits). 
However while in the throws of this the injestor will be immune to fire 
damage other than that caused by the poison. After recovery the injestors 
brain may have been damaged by the heat d4*10 points are perminently lost 
from intellegence and dexarity. Regularly changed cold baths while the 
poison runs its course will reduce this effect by 20 points.

Dragon sand also must be carried in a specially enchanted paper
envelop.  It will slowly eat through any solid other releasing a poisonous
gas as it does so. This gas does a 2d6 wounds at strenght 10. However it
evolves only slowly and so it only spreads at a foot a round per dose. 
Any liquid will quench it and prevent the gases creation but the sand 
tends to boil the liqiud one dose is capible of boiling a cup of water 
in a single round. Dragon sand while also cause flammible targets to 
catch fire.
