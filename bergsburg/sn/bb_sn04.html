<p>
<b>Description:</b> Heinrich has blond hair and blue eyes, has a gut that hangs over his belt and he is losing his hair. Heinrich is all of 47 years old which makes him one of the most senior watchmen in Beilheim.
<p>
<b>Background:</b> A couple of years ago Heinrich realised he had not many years left in the Bergsburg Watch and had little to show for his years of service to the city. He felt that he had spent all his life serving and following the law, and it had done nothing for him in return. Crime, as he had observed over the years, paid well and quickly.
<p>
Heinrich decided to get as much money and enjoy as many small luxuries as he could before he
became too old to work. So, he began to extort money from the shops and businesses along his beat, promising them greater protection from crime if they paid his small fees. Conversely, if they wouldn't or couldn't pay, he made it clear that misfortune would befall their business. Heinrich always implied that he was working for one of the notorious gangs of <a href="/bergsburg/districts/helmsberg.html">Helmsberg</a>. This was never the case but it was enough to make the traders of Beilheim fearful.
<p>
Outwardly Heinrich is a jolly fellow and gets on well with his fellow Watchmen. He is sociable and good at his job. He had many years of blameless service behind him which stood him in good stead when he turned to crime. He has dedicated so many years to the service that many wouldn't believe any accusations without strong evidence. Heinrich counts on this reputation to protect him. His seniors consider him above reproach and the little suspicion he has fallen under recently, which might have got a younger, less trustworthy officer into trouble, only served to underline to them the increased difficulties of law enforcement in the modern age.
<p>
Heinrich is well known to many petty criminals in the area of Beilheim just north of the Ruhigerstrasse. Crooks in the area know him as "Whistling Witzenber", and know him as an efficient and honest officer of the watch. Only a few know of his protection racket. Heinrich has even killed a local shopkeeper whom he suspected of spreading word of his extortion.
<p>
Heinrich has the complicity of three fellow watchmen in his crimes. These were all little more than thugs before he got them their jobs. They are grateful and loyal to him for this, for they could never have got such jobs without Heinrich vouching for their integrity.
<p>
Heinrich recently got a visit from a senior member of the Kreuzer gang (see the <a href="/bergsburg/districts/helmsberg.html">Helmsberg</a> district description). He made it clear that the Kreuzers were well aware of Heinrich's actions and that unless he started paying them a high proportion of his ill-gotten gains then he would be exposed.
