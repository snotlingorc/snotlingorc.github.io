<h1>The Landberg Building and Family</h1>
<h3>SN77 by <a href="/bergsburg/v2/authors.html#john_foody">John Foody</a></h3>
</center>

<div align=justify>

<p>One of the oldest buildings in <a href="/bergsburg/v2/districts/osttor.html">Osttor</a>, this three-story stone building is the home of The Landberg family and their tannery.  It still has the coat of arms of the von Rippelheim family above the door. They had built their house as a family home located in the middle of extensive grounds.  Over the years the family fortune's declined and the town grew ever nearer their door. Driven to desperation to try and pay their debts, the von Rippelheim family sold to the Landbergs, who ran a successful tannery business.

<p>The Landberg business has remained successful, handed down from father to son. Living in the top floor, the Landberg family is currently seventeen strong. However, its future hangs in the balance. Josef Landberg, the current head of the family, is dying. Unfortunately he is taking his time over it. His three sons are locked in a bitter battle for control.  Even more unfortunately, they are battling over a troubled company. Despite the thriving tannery business Josef invested much of the family's fortune in ill-judged ventures.

<p>The eldest son Stefan, left the family business and started speculating in local gold mines. He wants his share of the business in gold to help shore up his failing finances. He has no interest in the Tannery but sees it as his right as eldest son.  He frequently argues with his youngest sibling Josef, who loves the trade and stubbornly refuses to deal with Stefan at all, arguing he is owed nothing as he left the business behind.  That their arguments do not get out of hand is thanks to the middle son, Helmut. He runs the place, but knows he will not inherit it all. He is also prone to periods of depression.  He can control these through a herbal remedy, but this makes him irritable and short-tempered.

<p>Recently the company has suffered a number of problems.  Materials have been destroyed, workers threatened, the building damaged. Locals have also made it known that they are unhappy with having the tannery in their neighbourhood, offended by the smell and the mess. All these are result of the <a href="/bergsburg/v2/sn/bb_sn76.html">Hofbauer-Bodelstein Trading Company</a> looking to force them out of their building so they can buy it. The Hofbauer-Bodelstein lawyer <a href="/bergsburg/v2/sn/bb_sn76.html#randolf">Randolf Treman</a> has befriended Stefan. Together they spend time drinking and frequenting Lydia Wildfeuer's House of Pleasure.  Treman has also been more than generous in lending Landberg money. Only recently has he mentioned, in passing, that he is looking for somewhere suitable to purchase in Osttor. Stefan has taken this on board and knows that if he can convince the family to sell, then Treman would give him a fair price. Stefan has borrowed heavily from the Guldberg Banking House, something Treman is fully aware of. He has
 even had an unofficial meeting with a representative of the bank, ensuring they know of his interest in the building
